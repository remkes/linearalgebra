    <title>New Environments</title>
    <p>
      In the definitions in the previous section, euclidean space was
      defined in any dimension we want. In addition to the
      conventional and known two and three dimensional spaces, by
      writing a vector with many components, we can consider any
      dimension we want. This is a strange and new thing. Conventional
      geometry deals with this we can draw and see, which are things
      that necessarily exist in two or three dimensions. Higher
      dimensions are something new and bizzare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, I want to talk through some constructions that
      might help to build some intuition and familiarity with higher
      dimensions. We need indirect methods, since we can't see higher
      dimensional spaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In some context, particularly physics after general
      relativility, the fourth dimension is often treated as time.
      That's not the approach in this course. We're interested in
      treating all these higher dimensions as geometry. We want to
      imagine objects, path, intersections, and many other geometric
      ideas in these higher dimensions. In the applications of linear
      algebra, higher dimensions can be given a huge variety of
      interpretation, including treating one dimension as time. Those
      applications come afterwards. In linear algebra, we treat all
      dimensions geometrically.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-spheres">
    <title>Spheres</title>
    <p>
      In the plane, all points that are exactly one unit from the
      origin form the unit circle. In three dimensional space, all
      points that are exactly one unit from the origin form the
      unit sphere. Following this logic, we can construct
      <qt>spheres</qt> in higher dimensions. In any <m>\RR^n</m>, all
      objects which are exactly one unit from the origin form the
      sphere in that dimension. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The naming convention for these spheres in mathematics is
      slighly unexpected. A sphere is usually considered a hollow
      object: it doesn't include the points inside it, which are
      closer than one unit to the origin. The normal sphere in
      <m>\RR^3</m> is, in this way, thought of as a two-dimensional
      surface in three dimensions. On the surface of the sphere (like
      on the surface of the earth), movement in a small area looks
      like movement in two dimensions. For this reason, the sphere in
      <m>\RR^3</m> is called the <m>2</m>-sphere. Following this
      logic, the sphere in <m>\RR^n</m> is called the
      <m>(n-1)</m>-sphere. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What do we know about these higher dimensional spheres? First,
      we can look at their equations.  In <m>\RR^2</m>,  the circle
      has the equation<m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. In <m>\RR^3</m> the sphere
      (the <m>2</m>-sphere) has equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1</m>.
      The sphere (<m>3</m>-sphere) in <m>\RR^4</m> has equation <m>w^2
      + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1</m>. The sphere
      (<m>(n-1)</m>-sphere) in <m>\RR^n</m> has equation <m>x_1^2 +
      x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 = 1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These equations are useful for studying the algebra of the
      object. We can determine which points are one any given sphere
      using these equations. The points

          1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
        \end{pmatrix} \amp \amp 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ 0 \\
          \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} 
        \end{pmatrix} \amp \amp 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} \\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} \\
          \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{12}} 
        \end{pmatrix} \amp \amp 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \\ 0 \\ \frac{7}{\sqrt{74}} \\ \frac{5}{\sqrt{74}}
        \end{pmatrix} 
        <mrow>
      </md>
      are all points on the <m>3</m>-sphere in <m>\RR^4</m>, since
      they all satisfy the equation of that sphere. However, these
      equations aren't that useful for getting an intuitive sense of
      what these spheres look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting this intuitive sense is really fundamentally difficult.
      It is worth repeating that the major challenge of higher
      dimensions geometry is the fact that we can't see it, since we
      are so used to seeing our geometry. However, there are still
      some indirect geometric ways of thinking that can help us
      understand higher dimensions objects. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If we take the normal sphere in <m>\RR^3</m> and slice it
      horizontally, each cross section is a circle. The cross section
      at the widest point is a unit circle, and as we move up or down,
      the cross-sections are smaller and smaller circles. We can think
      of the sphere as an object whose slices are all circle (though
      it is not the unique object with that property). We could also
      think of the sphere as an infinite stack if infinitly think
      circles, starting with small circles, growing to the equator and
      the unit circles, and then shrinking again as we move up the
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notion of slicing works in higher dimensions. The
      <m>3</m>-sphere in <m>\RR^4</m> has slices which are spheres.
      That's a bizzare idea (because trying to think in four
      dimensions is a bizzare task), and one that defies
      visualization. But it is a way of thinking about the
      <m>3</m>-sphere. It is an object whose slices are spheres and
      can be thought of as infinitely many spheres stacked up. This is
      still strange: the stacking happens in a new direction, so that
      all point on <qt>adjacemt</qt> sphere are right next to each
      other, just like the circles stack up to make the ordinary
      sphere are right next to each other. But maybe this helps us
      think a bit about what kind of object the <m>3</m>-sphere is.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-cubes">
    <title>Cubes</title>
    <p>
      After the sphere, I want to consider square objects. Let's start
      at the very beginning, in <m>\RR^1</m>, which is just the number
      line. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <sq>cube</sq> n <m>\RR</m> is the interval
            <m>[0,1]</m>. It can be defined by the inequality <m>0
            \leq x \leq 1</m> for <m>x \in \RR</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^2</m>, the <sq>cube</sq> is the just the
            ordinary (solid) square. It is all vectors
            <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}</m> such that <m>0
            \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1</m>. The square
            can be formed by taking two intervals and connecting the
            matching vertices. It has four vertices and four edges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^3</m>, the square object is the (solid) cube.
            It is all vectors <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z
            \end{pmatrix}</m> , such that each coordinate is in the
            interval <m>[0,1]</m>.  It can also be seen as two squares
            with matching vertices connected. Two square gives eight
            vertices. Eight square edges plus four connecting edges
            gives the twelve edges of the cube. It also has six square
            faces.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then we can simply keep extending. In <m>\RR^4</m>, the
            set of all vectors <m>\begin{pmatrix} w \\ x \\ y \\ z
            \end{pmatrix}</m> where all coordinates are in the interal
            <m>[0,1]</m> is called the hypercube or 4-cube. It can be
            seen as two cubes with pairwise edges connected. The cubes
            each have eight vertices, so the 4-cubes has sixteen
            vertices. Each cube has 12 edges, and their are 8 new
            connecting edges, so the 4-cube has 32 edges. It has 24
            faces and 8 cells. A cell (or 3-face) here is a three
            dimensional <sq>edge</sq> of a four (or higher)
            dimensional object.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There is an <m>n</m>-cube in each <m>\RR^n</m>, consisting
            of all vectors where all components are in the interval
            <m>[0,1]</m>. Each can be constructed by joining two
            copies of a lower dimensional <m>(n-1)</m>-cube with edges
            between matching vertices.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The cube is an example of a solid object with flat sides and
      sharp corners. Such objects are called polytopes (polygons in
      two dimensions). The study of polytopes in higher dimensions is
      itself a rich branch of mathematics with a long history.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-cross-polytopes">
    <title>Cross-Polytopes</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the cubes, I want to introduce another kind of
      higher dimensional polytope, called the cross-polytope. It
      generalizes the idea of a diamond shape in two and three
      dimensions. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^2</m>, the cross-polytope is the diamond with
            vertices <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m> ,
            <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m>,
            <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}</m> , and
            <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}</m> . In each
            dimension, two vertices are added at <m>\pm 1</m> in the
            new axis direction, and edges are added connecting the two
            new vertices to each existing vertex (but the two new
            vertices are not connected to each other).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^3</m>, the cross-polytope is the octahedron,
            with vertices <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
            \end{pmatrix}</m> , <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 0
            \end{pmatrix}</m> , <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0
            \end{pmatrix}</m>, <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 0
            \end{pmatrix}</m> , <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1
            \end{pmatrix}</m>, and <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\
            -1\end{pmatrix}</m> .
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In higher dimensions, the vertices are all vectors with
            <m>\pm 1</m> in one component and zero in all other
            components. Each vertex is connected to all other
            vertices except its opposite.

      A regular polyhedron is one where all edges, faces, cells,
      n-cells are the same size/shape and, in addition, the angles
      between all the edges, faces, cells, n-cells are also the same
      whever the various objects meet. In addition, the polyhedron is
      called convex if all angles are greater that
      <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians. The study of convex regular
      polyhedra is an old and celebrated part of mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^2</m>, there are infinitely many convex regular
      polyhedra: the regular polygons with any number of sides. In
      <m>\RR^3</m>, in addition to the cube, tetrahedron and
      octahedron, there are only two others: the dodecahedron and the
      icosahedron. These were well known to the ancient Greeks and
      are called the <em>Platonic Solids</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three families (cube, tetrahedron, cross-polytope) extend to
      all dimensions, but the dodecahedron and icoahedron are
      particular to <m>\RR^3</m>. It is a curious and fascinating
      question to ask what other special, unique convex regular
      polyhedra occur in higher dimesions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^4</m>, there are three others. They are called the
      24-cell, the 120-cell and 600-cell, named for the number of
      3-dimensional cells they contain (the same way the 4-cubes
      contains 8 3-cubes). The 24-cell is built from 24 octahedral
      cells. The 120-cell is built from dodecahedral cells and the
      600-cell is built from tetrahedral cells. The 120-cell, in some
      ways, extends the dodecahedron and the 600-cell extends the
      icosahedron. The 24-cell is unique to <m>\RR^4</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an amazing theorem of modern mathematics that in
      dimensions higher than <m>4</m>, there are no regular polyhedra
      other than the three families. Neither the icosahedron nor the
      dodecahedron extend, and there are no other erratic special
      polyhedra found in any higher dimension.
