    <title>New Environments</title>
    <p>
      In the definitions in the previous section, euclidean space was
      defined in any dimension we want. In addition to the
      conventional and known two and three dimensional spaces, by
      writing a vector with many components, we can consider any
      dimension we want. This is a strange and new thing. Conventional
      geometry deals with this we can draw and see, which are things
      that necessarily exist in two or three dimensions. Higher
      dimensions are something new and bizzare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, I want to talk through some constructions that
      might help to build some intuition and familiarity with higher
      dimensions. We need indirect methods, since we can't see higher
      dimensional spaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In some context, particularly physics after general
      relativility, the fourth dimension is often treated as time.
      That's not the approach in this course. We're interested in
      treating all these higher dimensions as geometry. We want to
      imagine objects, path, intersections, and many other geometric
      ideas in these higher dimensions. In the applications of linear
      algebra, higher dimensions can be given a huge variety of
      interpretation, including treating one dimension as time. Those
      applications come afterwards. In linear algebra, we treat all
      dimensions geometrically.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-spheres">
    <title>Spheres</title>
    <p>
      In the plane, all points that are exactly one unit from the
      origin form the unit circle. In three dimensional space, all
      points that are exactly one unit from the origin form the
      unit sphere. Following this logic, we can construct
      <qt>spheres</qt> in higher dimensions. In any <m>\RR^n</m>, all
      objects which are exactly one unit from the origin form the
      sphere in that dimension. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The naming convention for these spheres in mathematics is
      slighly unexpected. A sphere is usually considered a hollow
      object: it doesn't include the points inside it, which are
      closer than one unit to the origin. The normal sphere in
      <m>\RR^3</m> is, in this way, thought of as a two-dimensional
      surface in three dimensions. On the surface of the sphere (like
      on the surface of the earth), movement in a small area looks
      like movement in two dimensions. For this reason, the sphere in
      <m>\RR^3</m> is called the <m>2</m>-sphere. Following this
      logic, the sphere in <m>\RR^n</m> is called the
      <m>(n-1)</m>-sphere. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What do we know about these higher dimensional spheres? First,
      we can look at their equations.  In <m>\RR^2</m>,  the circle
      has the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. In <m>\RR^3</m> the sphere
      (the <m>2</m>-sphere) has equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1</m>.
      The sphere (<m>3</m>-sphere) in <m>\RR^4</m> has equation <m>w^2
      + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1</m>. The sphere
      (<m>(n-1)</m>-sphere) in <m>\RR^n</m> has equation <m>x_1^2 +
      x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 = 1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These equations are useful for studying the algebra of the
      object. We can determine which points are one any given sphere
      using these equations. The points
      <md>

          1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
        \end{pmatrix} \amp \amp 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ 0 \\
          \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} 
        \end{pmatrix} \amp \amp 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} \\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} \\
          \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{12}} 
        \end{pmatrix} \amp \amp 
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 \\ 0 \\ \frac{7}{\sqrt{74}} \\ \frac{5}{\sqrt{74}}
        \end{pmatrix} 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      are all points on the <m>3</m>-sphere in <m>\RR^4</m>, since
      they all satisfy the equation of that sphere. However, these
      equations aren't that useful for getting an intuitive sense of
      what these spheres look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting this intuitive sense is really fundamentally difficult.
      It is worth repeating that the major challenge of higher
      dimensions geometry is the fact that we can't see it, since we
      are so used to seeing our geometry. However, there are still
      some indirect geometric ways of thinking that can help us
      understand higher dimensions objects. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If we take the normal sphere in <m>\RR^3</m> and slice it
      horizontally, each cross section is a circle. The cross section
      at the widest point is a unit circle, and as we move up or down,
      the cross-sections are smaller and smaller circles. We can think
      of the sphere as an object whose slices are all circle (though
      it is not the unique object with that property). We could also
      think of the sphere as an infinite stack if infinitly think
      circles, starting with small circles, growing to the equator and
      the unit circles, and then shrinking again as we move up the
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notion of slicing works in higher dimensions. The
      <m>3</m>-sphere in <m>\RR^4</m> has slices which are spheres.
      That's a bizzare idea (because trying to think in four
      dimensions is a bizzare task), and one that defies
      visualization. But it is a way of thinking about the
      <m>3</m>-sphere. It is an object whose slices are spheres and
      can be thought of as infinitely many spheres stacked up. This is
      still strange: the stacking happens in a new direction, so that
      all point on <qt>adjacemt</qt> sphere are right next to each
      other, just like the circles stack up to make the ordinary
      sphere are right next to each other. But maybe this helps us
      think a bit about what kind of object the <m>3</m>-sphere is.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-cubes">
    <title>Cubes</title>
    <p>
      After the sphere, I want to consider square objects. To
      understand the higher dimensional cubes, I want to talk about
      how we build each cube from lower dimensional pieces.  Let's
      start at the very beginning, in <m>\RR^1</m>, which is just the
      number line. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The <sq>cube</sq> n <m>\RR</m> is the interval
      <m>[0,1]</m>. It can be defined by the inequality <m>0
      \leq x \leq 1</m> for <m>x \in \RR</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^2</m>, the <sq>cube</sq> is the just the
      ordinary square. It is all vectors
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}</m> such that <m>0
      \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1</m>. The square
      can be formed by taking two intervals (1-dimensional cubes) and
      connecting the matching vertices. This will become the way in
      which we build higher dimensional cubes: each cube is form of
      two cubes from the previous dimensionw with all the matching
      vertices connected. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-square">
      <caption>The Square</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/figure12"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Let's look at <m>\RR^3</m> and follow the algorithm I suggested.
      If I take two squares and connected the matching vertices, I do
      indeed get the ordinary cube. One of the two squares is the
      front of the cube and the other is the back (or top and bottom,
      left and right, depending on how you orient the pieces). To make
      this a bit more clear, in <xref ref="figure-cube" />, I've drawn
      the two original squares in black and the four connecting lines
      in red. I could also describe the cube (including its interior)
      as all point where the coordinate satisfyt <m>x \in [0,1]</m>,
      <m>y \in [0,1]</m> and <m>z \in [0,1]</m>. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-cube">
      <caption>The Cube</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/figure11"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Then we can simply keep extending. In <m>\RR^4</m>, I will take
      two copies of the 3D cube and connect all the matching vertices.
      In <xref ref="figure-tesseract" />, I've shown the connecting
      lines again in red. This diagram is a poor picture, being a 2D
      representation of a 4D object, but it does give some idea of
      the construction of the shape. The 4D cube is often called the
      tesseract. I could again describe it as all vectors in
      <m>\RR^4</m> such that <m>w \in [0,1]</m>, <m>x \in [0,1]</m>,
      <m>y \in [0,1]</m> and <m>z \in [0,1]</m>. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-tesseract">
      <caption>The Tesseract</caption>
      <image width="90%" source="images/figure13"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      There is an <m>n</m>-cube in each <m>\RR^n</m>, consisting
      of all vectors where all components are in the interval
      <m>[0,1]</m>. Each can be constructed by joining two
      copies of a lower dimensional <m>(n-1)</m>-cube with edges
      between matching vertices. I haven't tried to draw diagrams for
      any of these higher dimensional cubes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cube is an example of a solid object with flat sides and
      sharp corners. Such objects are called polytopes (polygons in
      two dimensions). The study of polytopes in higher dimensions is
      itself a rich branch of mathematics with a long history.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-cross-polytopes">
    <title>Cross-Polytopes</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the cubes, I want to introduce another kind of
      higher dimensional polytope, called the cross-polytope. It
      generalizes the idea of a diamond shape in two and three
      dimensions. It lets me show another way of trying to get a sense
      of what higher dimensional object look like. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^2</m>, the cross-polytope is the diamond with
      vertices <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m> ,
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m>,
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}</m> , and
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}</m> . In each
      dimension, cross-polytopes are built by adding two vertices at
      <m>\pm 1</m> in the new axis direction. Then, edges are added
      connecting the two new vertices to each existing vertex (but the
      two new vertices are not connected to each other).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-2-cross">
      <caption>The 2-Cross-Polytope (Diamond)</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/figure14"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^3</m>, if we take the diamond, add two point on
      either side, and connect the new points to all four original
      vertices of the diamond, we are essentially building a square
      pyramid on either side of the diamond. The result is called the
      octahedron and has vertices <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m> , <m>\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m> , <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m>, <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m> , <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1
      \end{pmatrix}</m>, and <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\
      -1\end{pmatrix}</m>. In <xref ref="figure-3-cross" />, I've
      tried to draw the octahedron in perspective, to give a sense of
      it as a 3D object. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-3-cross">
      <caption>The 3-Cross-Polytope (Octahedron)</caption>
      <image width="90%" source="images/figure15"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We can continue to build cross-polytopes in higher dimensions
      using this process: adding vertices on either side and
      connection the new vertices to all previous vertices (but not to
      each other). If we choose the new vertices as point in the new
      axis direction, then all the vertices of the
      <m>n</m>-cross-polytope are vertces with <m>\pm 1</m> in one
      component and zero in all other components. Each vertex is
      connected to all other vertices except its opposite. I haven't
      tried to draw diagrams of any of these higher cross-polytopes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One way of understanding higher dimensional object (since we
      can't directly see them), is to just draw their lower
      dimensional components. For polyhedra, we can do this by only
      drawing their vertices and edges (and not trying to representing
      the higher dimensional structures that includes those vertices
      and edges). I'm going to do this for the
      cross-polytopes to demonstrate the idea. The diamond
      (2-cross-polytope) has four vertices with all connections except
      for oppostive vertices.
      <figure xml:id="figure-2-cross-vertex">
        <caption>The 2-Cross-Polytope (Diamond) Vertex Diagram</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/figure16"/>
      </figure>
      The octahedron is the 3-cross polytope. We tried to draw a 3D
      image in perspective earlier. However, if I don't try to get a
      3D perspective and just draw the vertices and edges, I get the
      vertex diagram. Like the diamond, all edges except for those
      directly opposite are connected. 
      <figure xml:id="figure-3-cross-vertex">
        <caption>The 3-Cross-Polytope (Octaheron) Vertex Diagram</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/figure17"/>
      </figure>
      The construction of the higher cross-polytopes, where we add two
      vertices and connection them to all existing vertices,
      consistently builds a set of vertices where each vertex is
      attached, by an edge, to all other vertices except for the one
      direclty opposite it. If we collapse the vertices and edges onto
      a 2D diagram, that means we draw all the lines between our
      vertices except those directly opposite. The 4-cross polytope
      has <m>8</m> vertices connected in this way. 
      <figure xml:id="figure-4-cross-vertex">
        <caption>The 4-Cross-Polytope Vertex Diagram</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/figure18"/>
      </figure>
      The 5-cross-polytope has <m>10</m> vertices connected this way.
      <figure xml:id="figure-5-cross-vertex">
        <caption>The 5-Cross-Polytope Vertex Diagram</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/figure19"/>
      </figure>
      We can go as far as we want in this way. Each time we go up a
      dimension, we add two vertices. The 8-cross-polytope (in
      <m>\RR^8</m> has <m>16</m> vertices connected this way.
      <figure xml:id="figure-8-cross-vertex">
        <caption>The 8-Cross-Polytope Vertex Diagram</caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure20"/>
      </figure>
      The 16-cross-polytope (in <m>\RR^{16}</m>) has <m>32</m>
      vertice connected this way.
      <figure xml:id="figure-16-cross-vertex">
        <caption>The 16-Cross-Polytope Vertex Diagram</caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure21"/>
      </figure>
      These images are obviously not full pictures of these higher
      dimensional object, but there are some kind of 2D shadows of
      them which give us some information and intuition for the
      obejcts. Everything in higher dimensions must be done
      indirectly, but working indirectly, we can produce some useful
      and interesting visualizations that let us start to understand
      the objects.
