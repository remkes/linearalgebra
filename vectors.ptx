        <p>
          In linear algebra, ordinary numbers (intergers, rational
          numbers or real numbers) are called <term>scalars</term>
        </p>

          A <term>vector</term> is a finite ordered list of scalars.
          Vectors can be written either as columns or rows. If a
          vector is a list of the numbers <m>4</m>, <m>15</m>,
          <m>\pi</m> and <m>-e</m> (in that order), we write the
          vector in one of two ways.
          <md>
           <mrow>
             \amp \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 15 \\ \pi \\ e \end{pmatrix} 
             \amp \text{or} \amp \amp (4, 15, \pi, -e) \amp
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In these notes, we will exclusively use column vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. <term>Real Euclidean
          Space</term> or <term>Cartesian Space</term>, written
          <m>\RR^n</m>, is the set of all vectors of length <m>n</m>
          with real number entries. An arbitrary element of
          <m>\RR^n</m> is written as a column.
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We say that <m>\RR^n</m> has <term>dimension</term>
          <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The scalars <m>x_i</m> in a vector are called the
          <term>entries</term>, <term>coordinates</term> or
          <term>components</term> of that vector. Specifically,
          <m>x_1</m> is the first coordinate, <m>x_2</m> is the second
          coordinate, and so on. For <m>\RR^2</m>, <m>\RR^3</m> and
          <m>\RR^4</m>, we use the letters <m>w,x,y,z</m> instead of
          <m>x_i</m>
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \amp \in \RR^2 \amp
              \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\\ z \end{pmatrix} \amp \in \RR^3
              \amp \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x\\ y\\ z \end{pmatrix} \amp

      <statement>
        <p>
          In any <m>\RR^n</m>, the <term>origin</term> is the unique
          point given by a vector of zeros. It is also called the
          zero vector. It is considered the centre point of Cartesian
          space.

      Cartesian space, particularly the Cartesian plane, is a familiar
      object from high-school mathematics. We usually visualize
      Cartesian space by drawing axes, one in each independent
      perpendicular direction. In this visualization, the vector
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}</m> corresponds to the
      unique point we get moving <m>a</m> units in the direction of
      the <m>x</m> axis and <m>b</m> units in the direction of the
      <m>y</m> axis. <xref
      ref="points-in-the-cartesian-plane">Figure</xref> shows the
      location of several points in <m>\RR^2</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="points-in-the-cartesian-plane">
      <caption>Points in the Cartesian Plane <m>\RR^2</m></caption>
      <image width="85%" source="images/figure1.svg" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      As with <m>\RR^2</m>, the point <m> \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c
      \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^3</m> is the unique point we find by
      moving <m>a</m> units in the <m>x</m> direction, <m>b</m> units
      in the <m>y</m> direction and <m>c</m> units in the <m>z</m>
      direction. When we visualize <m>\RR^2</m>, we conventionally
      write the <m>x</m> axis horizontally, with a positive direction
      to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis vertically, with a positive
      direction upwards. For <m>\RR^3</m>, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      axes form a flat plane and the <m>z</m> axis extend vertically
      from that plan, as shown in <xref
      ref="points-in-cartesian-three-space">Figure</xref>. Notice, in
      both cases, we needed to choose directions for the axes.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A choice of axis directions in a visualization of
          <m>\RR^n</m> is called an <term>orientation</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      While we can visualize <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> relatively
      easily and efficiently, but we can't visualize any higher
      <m>\RR^n</m>. However, this doesn't prevent us from working in
      higher dimensions. We need to rely on the algebraic
      descriptions of vectors instead of the drawings and
      visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>, we see
      the different axes as fundementally different perpendicular
      directions. We can think of <m>\RR^2</m> as the space with two
      independent directions and <m>\RR^3</m> as the space with three
      independent directions. Similarly, <m>\RR^4</m> is the space
      with four perpendicular, independent directions, even though it
      is impossible to visualize such a thing. Likewise, <m>\RR^n</m>
      is the space with <m>n</m> independent directions.

    <title>Points or Directions?</title>
    <p>
      We can think of a element of <m>\RR^2</m>, say
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as both the point
      located at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> and the
      vector drawn from the origin to the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1
      \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as shown in <xref
      ref="points-and-directions">Figure</xref>. Though these two
      ideas are distinct, we will frequently change perspective
      between them. Part of becoming proficient in vector geometry is
      becoming accustomed to the switch between the perspectives of
      points and directions.

    <title>Linear Operations</title>
    <p>
      The environment for linear algebra is <m>\RR^n</m>. Algebra is
      concerned with operations on sets, so we want to know what
      operations we can perform on <m>\RR^n</m>. There are several.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>sum</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in
          <m>\RR^n</m> is the sum taken componentwise..
          <me>
            u + v = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\
            v_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2
            \\ \vdots \\ u_n + v_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The sum is visuzliazed by placing the start of the second vector
      at the end of the first, as in <xref
      ref="visualizing-vector-addition">Figure</xref>. Note that we
      can only add two vectors in the same dimension. We can't add a
      vector in <m>\RR^2</m> to a vector in <m>\RR^3</m>.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u</m> is a vector in <m>\RR^n</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m>
          is a real number, then the <term>scalar
          multiplication</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>a</m> is
          multiplication by <m>a</m> in each component of <m>u</m>.
          By convention, scalar multiplication is written with the
          scalar on the left of the vector.
          <me>
            au = a \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} au_1 \\ au_2 \\ \vdots \\
            au_n \end{pmatrix}

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Though there will be other <sq>multiplications</sq> to come, we
      generally say that we can't multiply vectors together in any way
      reminiscent of numbers. Instead, we can only multiply by
      scalars. Scalar multiplication is visualizing by scaling the
      vector by the value of the scalar. (Hence the term
      <sq>scalar</sq>!) If the scalar is negative, the direction is
      also reversed, as in <xref
      ref="visualizing-scalar-multiplication">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      Scalar multiplication also lets us define the difference between
      vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The difference between two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          the vector <m>u + (-1)v</m>, defined using addition and
          scalar multiplication. This works out to be componentwise
          subtraction.
          <me>
            u - v = u + (-1) v= \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots
            \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} + (-1) \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\
            \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_ 1\\
            u_2 - v_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n - v_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          With respect to some set of scalars (such as <m>\RR</m>),
          whenever we find a mathematical structure which has the two
          properties of addition and scalar multiplication, we call
          the structure <term>linear</term>. <m>\RR^n</m> is a linear
          space, because vectors allow for addition and scalar
          multiplication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>length</term> of a vector <m>u</m> in <m>\RR^n</m>
          is written <m>|u|</m> and is given by a generalized form of
          the Pythagorean rule for right triangles.
          <me>
            |u| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This length is also called the <term>norm</term> of the
          vector. A vector of length one is called a <term>unit
          vector</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If we think of vectors as directions from the origin towards a
      point, this definition of length gives exactly what we expect:
      the physical length of that arrow in <m>\RR^2</m> and
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Past <m>\RR^3</m>, we don't have a natural notion
      of length. This definition serves as a reasonable
      generalization to <m>\RR^4</m> and higher dimensions which we
      can't visualize. Note also that <m>|u| = 0</m> only if <m>u</m>
      is the zero vector. All other vectors have positive length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the square root is annoying and we find it convenient to
      work with the square of length.
      <me>
        |u|^2 = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The notions of length and difference allow us to define the
      distance between two vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>distance between two vectors</term> <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the length of their difference:
          <m>|u-v|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      You can check from the definition that <m>|u-v| = |v-u|</m>, so
      distance doesn't depend on which comes first. If <m>|\cdot|</m>
      were absolute value in <m>\RR</m>, this definition would match
      the notion of distance between numbers on the number line.
      Difference and length are visualized in <xref
      ref="difference-and-length">Figure</xref>.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We briefly state two properties of vector lenghts without
          proof.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              |u+v| \amp  \leq |u| + |v| \amp  \hspace{1cm} \ \text{
              Triangle Inequality }
            </mrow> 
            <mrow>
              |au| \amp  = |a||u| \amp
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The last line deserves some attention for the notation. When we
      write <m>|a| |u|</m>, <m>|a|</m> is an absolute value of a real
      number and <m>|u|</m> is the length of a vector. The fact that
      they have the same notation is frustrating, but these notations
      are common. (Some text use double bars for the length of a
      vector, <m>||v||</m>, to avoid this particular issue).
