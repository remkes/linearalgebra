        <p>
          Sketch the graph of the function
          <me>
            f(x) = e^{-x} (x^2 + 3x - 6).
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Domain: Neither the exponential or the polynomial pieces of
          this function have any restrictions, so the domain is all
          real numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Range: The range it hard to determine at the start. We will
          return to this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuity: This is an elementary function, so it is
          continuous on its domain. The domain is all real numbers, so
          this function is continuous everywhere. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Intercepts: To find the <m>y</m> intercept, we simply
          evaluate the function at 0. 
          <me>
            f(0) = e^{-0} (0^2 + 30 - 6) = -6
          </me>
          There is a <m>y</m> intercept at <m>(0,-6)</m>. To find the
          <m>x</m> intercept, we need to solve <m>f(x) = 0</m>. Note
          that the exponential term can never be zero, so we just have
          the polynomial term. We use the quadratic formula, since
          this quadratic doesn't have whole number roots.

            <mrow>
              f(x) \amp = e^{-x} (x^2 + 3x - 6) = 0 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x^2 + 3x - 6 \amp = 0

            <mrow>
              x \amp = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - (-24)}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm
              \sqrt{33}}{2}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          We have <m>x</m> intercepts at two points: <m>x = \frac{-3
          + \sqrt{33}}{2} \doteq 1.372</m> and <m>x = \frac{-3 -
          \sqrt{33}}{2} \doteq -4.372</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Symmetry: There is no symmetry here. There is no periodic
          symmetry because this is not a trigononmetric function.
          There is no even or odd symmetry because <m>f(-x)</m> does
          not simplify to either <m>f(x)</m> or <m>-f(x)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Limits and Asymptotoes: There are no breaks in the domain,
          so there is no possibility of vertical asymptotes. We can
          look at the limits to <m>\pm \infty</m> for horizontal
          asymptotes. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} e^{-x} (x^2 + 3x - 6) = 0 
          </me>
          Asymptotically, the exponential decay is dominant over the
          polynomial growth, so the function approaches 0. This means
          that the function has a horizontal asymptote <m>y=0</m> in
          the positive direction. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} e^{-x} (x^2 + 3x - 6) =
            \infty
          </me>
          For negative numbers, both the polynomial and exponential
          functions grow without bound. There is no horizontal
          asymptote in the negative direction. 
        </p>
        <p>
          First Derivative: We take the derivative. For ease of
          working with is for the future steps, I'll factor out the
          exponential term and collect the polynomial terms after
          taking the derivative.

          </md>
          We set the derivative equal to zero and solve for the
          critical points. Notes, again, that the exponential can never
          be zero, so we only need to look at the quadratic.

          We have two critical points. Their approximate values ate
          <m>x \doteq -3.541</m> and <m>x \doteq 2.251</m>. We move on
          to the intervals determined by these critical points. The
          domain is all reals, so we have three intervals. Note also
          that the exponential term is always positive, so the sign of
          the derivative is entirely determined by the quadratic.

          This gives us a minimum at the first critical point and a
          maximum at the second. With the extrema and the intervals of
          increase and decrease, we are done with the first

          We set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for the
          potential inflection points. Notes, again, that the
          exponential can never be zero, so we only need to look at
          the quadratic.

          Range again: We know the function diverges to infinity as
          <m>x \righarrow -\infty</m>, so there is no upper bound.
          However, the minimum is a lower bound, since the function
          has a horizontal asymptote in the positive direction. The
          minimum happens at <m>x = \frac{-1-\sqrt{37}}{2}</m>.
          Evaluating the function at this point is awkward, but I
          asked a computer for an approximate value: <m>f \left(
          \frac{-1-\sqrt{37}}{2} \right) \doteq -140.915</m>.
          Therefore, the range (in approximate values) if
          <m>(-140.914, \infty)</m>

          Domain: To avoid dividing by zero, we need to exclude <m>x =

          Continuity: This is an elementary function, so it is
          continuous on its domain. There are two pieces of

          Intercepts: To find the <m>y</m> intercept, we simply

            f(0) = \frac{0-9}{4(0)-5} = \frac{-9}{-5} = \frac{9}{5} 
          </me>
          There is a <m>y</m> intercept at <m>\left(0,\frac{9}{5}
          \right)</m>. To find the
          <m>x</m> intercept, we need to solve <m>f(x) = 0</m>. To do
          this, we only need to look at the numerator, since a
          rational function is 0 only when its numerator is zero.

          The point <m>x=9</m> is in the domain, so <m>(9,0)</m> is an
          intercept.

        <p>
          Symmetry: There is no symmetry here. There is no periodic
          symmetry because this is not a trigononmetric function.
          There is no even or odd symmetry because <m>f(-x)</m> does
          not simplify to either <m>f(x)</m> or <m>-f(x)</m>.

        <p>
          Limits and Asymptotoes: We have an undefined point at <m>x =
          \frac{5}{4}</m>, so we take the limits approaching this from
          the left and the right to see if there is a vertical
          asymptote. (We do the two sides seperately to give us more
          information about whether to draw the function approaching
          positive or negative <m>\infty</m>.0
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \frac{5}{4}^+} \frac{x-9}{4x-5} =
            -\infty 
          </me>
          The numerator approaches a finite number and the denominator
          approaches 0, so this does diverge to <m>\pm \infty</m>. Looking
          at the sign, for numbers slightly larger than
          <m>\frac{5}{4}</m>, the numerator is negative and the
          denominator is positive, so this limit approahces <m> -
          \infty</m>.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \frac{5}{4}^-} \frac{x-9}{4x-5} =
            \infty
          </me>
          The numerator approaches a finite number and the denominator
          approaches 0, so this does diverge to <m>\pm \infty</m>. Looking
          at the sign, for numbers slightly smaller than
          <m>\frac{5}{4}</m>, the numerator is negative and the
          denominator is also negative, so this limit approahces <m>
          \infty</m>. This means that the line <m>x = \frac{5}{4}</m>
          is a vertical asymptote.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can look at the limits to <m>\pm \infty</m> for
          horizontal asymptotes. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x-9}{4x-5} = \frac{1}{4} 
          </me>
          Asymptotically, the numerator and denominator has the same
          order, so we look at the leading coefficients to evaluate
          the limit. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} \frac{x-9}{4x-5} = \frac{1}{4} 
          </me>
          The same behaviour holds in the negative direction as well.
          Both numerator and denominator will be negative, which
          cancels out, leaving just the ratio of the leading
          coefficients.

          We set the derivative equal to zero and solve for the
          critical points. However, this fraction has a constant
          numerator, so it can never be zero. There are no critical
          points, hence no possible minima or maxima. However, we
          still have to look at the intervals to see where the
          function is increasing or decreasing. The domain has two
          intervals, since it is divided up by the undefined point

          the function is growing up from this asympote, approaching

          at <m>y = \frac{1}{4}</m>. Therefore, all number less than

          Assuming that we restrict ourselves to the domain <m> t \gt
          0</m> (a reasonable assumption for most models which depend
          on time), this derivative is always positive. Therefore, the
          population is always increasing. In the limit, the
          derivative is getting very small, so the rate of increase is
          getting smaller and smaller over time as the population
          approaches 4 million.

        <p>
          Holistic analysis: These three observations give us a
          reasonable understanding of this model. This is like
          logistic growth (though not logistic growth, since it
          doesn't conform to the specific pattern with exponential
          functions). It starts with modest growth which slows over
          time as it approaches a steady value. This seams like an
          entirely reasonable model of population.

          Analyze and critique a model of temperature (in degree
          celcius) depending on ocean depth (in meters) given by the
          function
          <me>
            T(d) = 16 - \frac{\sqrt{d}}{3}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Starting value: we evaluate at <m>d=0</m> to get <m>T(0) =
          16 - 0 = 16</m>. The temperature as the surface of the water
          is 16 degree celcius. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Derivative: we take the derivative to determine the increase
          or decrease of the model. (With the variable <m>d</m>,
          Leibniz notation is somewhat awkward, so I'll use Newton's
          notation for this derivative). 
          <me>
            T^\prime(d) = 0 - \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{d}} =
            \frac{-1}{6 \sqrt{d}}
          </me>
          This derivative is always negative (assume the domain <m>d
          \gt 0</m>, since a negative depth doesn't make sense), so
          the temperature is always decreasing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Long term behaviour: we take the limit as <m>d \rightarrow
          \infty</m>. 
          <me>
            \lim_{d \rightarrow \infty} 16 - \frac{\sqrt{d}}{3} =
            \infty. 
          </me>
          The temperature gets lower and lower without bound. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Holistic analysis: The starting temperature seems
          reasonable: some oceans certainly have a surface water
          temperature of 16 degrees. The fact that the temperature
          decreases as we descend also makes sense: we expect the
          water to be cooler as we go deeper. For example, if <m> d =
          900m</m>, then <m>T(900) = 16 - 10 = 6</m>. At 900 meters
          below the surface, we've slowly dropped to 6 degree, which
          is believable. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the long term behaviour past this point because
          more problematic. Eventually, we get a negative value, which
          isn't that likely for deep oceans. If we allow the depth to
          continue further, we could get very large negative numbers,
          which make no sense. We can conclude this might be a
          reasonable model for the first while, maybe a kilometer or
          two of depth, but eventually the model breaks down and is no
          longer useful.

          Initial height: at time 0, we evaluate <m>H(0) = 4 + 0 + 0 =
          4</m>. The starting height is 4 cm. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Derivative: we take the derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dt} H(t) = \frac{d}{dt} 4 + 12t + 3 \sin (\pi t)
            = 0 + 12 + 3\pi \cos t = 12 + 3\pi \cos t 
          </me>
          The term <m>3 \pi \cos t</m> has minimum value <m>-3\pi
          \doteq 9.42</m>. When we add 12, even with this minimum
          value, the derivative is always positive. The derivative is
          relatively small at these points in the period of cosine,
          but larger at other points in the period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holistic analysis: We start a tree at 4cm. This is
          reasonable is we start measuring a seedling. The growth
          rate is always possible, which is also good -- trees don't
          normally start strinking. So far, this seems good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we explain the sine term? Why would we have a
          oscillation in the growth? The period of this sine term is
          1, and our units are years, so the period is 1 year.
          Oscillation of a growth rate in a year could be explained by
          seasonon variation, with (assuming Northern hemisphere)
          slower growth in the winter and faster growth in the summer.
          In this is the case, the overall rate of growth would be 12
          cm per year (which is reasonable for some tree species), but
          less that 3 cm per year in the slow season and closer to 20
          cm per year in the fast season. This makes sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, eventually this model becomes unreasonable. Linear
          growth is not sustainable for ever; eventually the tree will
          approach its maximum height and growth will slow. This
          models looks like a reasonable choice for the first number
          of years, but eventually must be discarded as the tree
          approaches maturity.

          Here we only have a differential equation, not a function.
          We could try to solve the differential equation (though we

          also use our implicit methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phase line analysis (not drawn here) shows that we have
          a steady state at <m>p=40</m>. The trajectory below 40 is
          downward and the trajectory above 40 is upwards. Therefore,
          40 is an unstable steady state. If the population starts
          below 40, it will decay to zero. If the polulation start
          above 40, it will grow without bound.
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems mostly reasonable. For whatever reasons, 40
          thousand is the minimum sustainable level for this
          population. The only limitation of this model is likely its
          long term behaviour, since growth without bound is not
          sustainable forever.

          Behaviours: there are three behaviours. For the first 100
          years, there is exponential decay. Then, for another 100
          years, there is sinusoidal oscillation, with a relatively
          small amplitude. Finally we revert to exponential decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long term behaviour: the limit (using the third function) as
          <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m> is 0, since this is an
          exponential decay function. In the long term, the radiation
          dissipates away. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Holistic analysis: exponential decay is expected behaviour
          for radiation, so that two exponential pieces are
          reasonable. The middle piece needs a bit more explanation:
          instead of decay, we have an oscilltion. This is a bit odd.
          It may be that there is some kind of periodic source of new
          radiation: waste being produced by some industrial process,
          perhaps, or radiative volcanic material from a natural
          source perhaps. In any case, something happens at 100 years
          to start this new behaviour and then something else happens
          at 200 years to stop this new behaviour and return to
          exponential decay. This may be plausible.

          How do you connect many of the tools in the course together
          to get a holistic idea of the shape and behaviour of a
          function?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the qualitative analysis of functions? What does it
          mean to discuss the behaviour of a function?
        </li>
        <li>
          What does it mean to critique a model?
