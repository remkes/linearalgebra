    <title>Prooving the Dot Product Properties</title>
    <p>
      If <xref ref="section-dot-product" />, there was a list of
      properties of the dot product. In this section, I'll demonstrate
      how to prove some of these properties. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The dot product is commutative. That is, iv <m>u, v \in
          \RR^n</m>, 
          <me>
            u \cdot v = v \cdot u
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          I'll write the vector in terms of their coodinates. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp u = \begin{pmatrix}
                u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \ldots \\ u_n
              \end{pmatrix}
              \amp \amp v = \begin{pmatrix}
                v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \\ \ldots \\ v_n
              \end{pmatrix}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then let's start with the left side and see if we can make a
          chain of equality that result in the right side. The first
          thing we use is the definition of the dot product. 
          <me>
            u \cdot v = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3 + \ldots + u_nv_n
          </me>
          Then each of the product <m>u_iv_i</m> are product of
          ordinary real number. Multiplicaton of real numbers is
          commutative, so we can interchange the order of each of
          these products.
          <me>
            u \cdot v = v_1u_1 + v_2u_2 + v_3u_3 + \ldots + v_nu_n
          </me>
          Then we can use the definition of the dot product again. The
          right side of the previous equation is, by definition, the
          dot product <m>v \cdot u</m>
          <me>
            u \cdot v = v \cdot u
          </me>
          That is the desired equality, so we have finished the proof.
          Notice, as with previous proofs, that the desired equation
          only shows up at the end of the proof. I never start with
          what I want to prove.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u \in \RR^n</m>, then 
          <me>
            u \cdot u = |u|^2 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          I write <m>u</m> in its coorsdinates.
          <me>
            u = \begin{pmatrix}
              u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \ldots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
          Then I'll start with the left side and use the definition of
          the dot product. 
          <me>
            u \cdot u = u_1u_1 + u_2u_2 + u_3u_3 + \ldots u_nu_n
          </me>
          I can write these products on the left as squares.
          <me>
            u \cdot u = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + \ldots + u_n^2
          </me>
          Since the right side is a sum of square, it is a positive
          number (or possibly zero is all the <m>u_i</m> are zero). As
          a positive number or zero, I can square root it and then
          square it.
          <me>
            u \cdot u = \left( \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + \ldots +
            u_n^2} \right)^2 
          </me>
          Then the thing inside the brackets is, by definition, the
          length of the vector <m>u</m>.
          <me>
            u \cdot u = \left( |u| \right)^2 = |u|^2 
          </me>
          This is the desire equation, so the proof is completed. 
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The dot product distributes over vector addition. That is,
          if <m>u,v,w \in \RR^n</m>, 
          <me>
            u \cdot (v + w) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          I'll write the three vectors in terms of their components.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp u = \begin{pmatrix}
                u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \ldots \\ u_n
              \end{pmatrix}
              \amp \amp v = \begin{pmatrix}
                v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \\ \ldots \\ v_n
              \end{pmatrix}
              \amp \amp w = \begin{pmatrix}
                w_1 \\ w_2 \\ w_3 \\ \ldots \\ w_n
              \end{pmatrix}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I'll start with the left side. I'll use the definition
          of vector addition and the dot product to write the left
          side in terms of components. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \cdot (v + w) \amp \begin{pmatrix}
                u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \ldots \\ u_n
              \end{pmatrix} \cdot 
              \begin{pmatrix}
                v_1 + w_1 \\ v_2 + w_2 \\ v_3 + w_3 \\ \ldots \\ v_n +
                w_n 
              \end{pmatrix}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = u_1(v_1 + w_1) + u_w(v_2 + w_2) + u_3(v_3 + w_3)
              + \ldots + u_n(v_n + w_n)
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then each of these products with fraction can be
          distributed, since this is all arithmetic or ordinary real
          numbers.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \cdot (v + w) \amp = (u_1v_1 + u_1w_1) + (u_2v_2 + u_2w_2) 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp + (u_3v_3 + u_3w_3) + \ldots + (u_nv_n + u_nw_n)
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then the right side is the sum of many products. I can
          rearrange this sum as I please, so I'll put all the terms
          with <m>v_i</m> first, then all those with <m>w_i</m>
          afterwards.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \cdot (v + w) \amp = (u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3 +
              \ldots + u_nv_n)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp + (u_1w_1 + u_2w_2 + u_3w_3 + \ldots + u_nw_n)
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I can use the definition of the dot product again. On
          the right side, the term in the first bracket is, by
          definition, <m>u \cdot v</m>. The term in the second brack
          it, again by definition, <m>u \cdot w</m>.
          <me>
            u \cdot (v + w) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w
          </me>
          This is the desired equation, so the proof is finished. 
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m>, then 
          <me>
            u \cdot (av) = (au) \cdot v = a (u \cdot v) 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          I'll write the two vectors in terms of their components.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp u = \begin{pmatrix}
                u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \ldots \\ u_n
              \end{pmatrix}
              \amp \amp v = \begin{pmatrix}
                v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \\ \ldots \\ v_n
              \end{pmatrix}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I want to consider this sum:
          <me>
            au_1v_1 + au_2v_2 + au_3v_3 + \ldots au_nv_n
          </me>
          I'm going to organize this sum in three difference ways,
          which will correspond to the three desire version in the
          equation in the proposition. Since I will only be arranging
          brackets for addition and multiplication of numbers in
          acceptable ways, all three of those organization are just
          calculating the same sum, so I can conclude all three are
          equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I'll factor the <m>a</m> out of the entire sum.
          <me>
            a(u_1v_2 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3 + \ldots u _nv_n)
          </me>
          What is in bracket is the definition of the dot product, so
          this is <m>a (u \cdot v)</m>. Next I'll bracket the <m>a</m>
          with the <m>u_i</m> components.
          <me>
            (au_1)v_2 + (au_2)v_2 + (au_3)v_3 + \ldots (au_n)v_n
          </me>
          This is, by definition, also a dot product. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              au_1 \\ au_2 \\ au_3 \\ \vdots \\ au_n 
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot 
            \begin{pmatrix}
              v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \\ \vdots \\ v_n
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
          The first vector in this dot product is, by definition, the
          scalar multiple of <m>u</m> by <m>a</m>. Therefore, this
          organization of the sum gives <m>(au) \cdot v</m>. Finally,
          I'll change the order of the multiplications and group
          <m>a</m> with the <m>v_i</m> components. 
          <me>
            u_1(av_2) + u_2(av_2) + u_3(av_3) + \ldots u_n(av_n)
          </me>
          This is, by definition, also a dot product. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \vdots \\ u_n 
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot 
            \begin{pmatrix}
              av_1 \\ av_2 \\ av_3 \\ \vdots \\ av_n
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
          The second vector in this dot product is, by definition, the
          scalar multiple of <m>v</m> by <m>a</m>. Therfore, this
          organization of the sumer gives <m>u \cdot (av)</m>. Since
          all three organizations are valid ways of calculating the
          sum, I conclude that 
          <me>
            u \cdot (av) = (au) \cdot v = a(u \cdot v)
          </me>, 
          which concludes the proof. 
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
