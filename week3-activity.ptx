          Here is a dataset.  Just by looking at the dataset, guess
          the doubling period and write a guess of the appropriate
          exponential function. Evaluate that exponential function
          (using a calculator or computer) and compare the values with
          the data.

        It looks like this data doubles about every five years. The
        starting values is 1. Putting that into our exponential form,
        the function that fits this is

          f(x) = 1 e^{(\frac{1}{5}\ln 2)x}

        It looks like this data doubles is something a little less
        than two years. Let's guess a doubling period of
        <m>\frac{9}{5}</m>. The
        starting values is 3. Putting that into our exponential form,
        the function that fits this is
        <me>
          f(x) = 3 e^{(\frac{5}{9}\ln 2)x}

        It looks like this data doubles every year, perhaps a little
        bit more than a year in some cases. We could guess a doubling
        period of <m>\frac{11}{10}</m>. With a starting value of 5,
        that gives us an exponential function.
        <me>
          f(x) = 5 e^{(\frac{10}{11}\ln 2)x}

            This guess was perhaps a little weaker. The function we
            produced is similar to the data, but seems to outpace it
            but a bit. A slightly smaller doubling period might have
            been more appropriate.

          Draw a phase line for the differential equation
          <me>
            \frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 - 9p + 18.
          </me>
          Determine the steady states and trajectories, then classify
          the steady states. You may assume this is a population
          model, for that <m>p \geq 0</m> and 0 is always a steady
          state.

          <image width="100%" source="images/figure73" />
        </figure>
        To calculate the phase line, we need the zeros of the right
        side of the equation. This is a quadratic and it factors as
        <m>(p-6)(p-3)</m>. Therefore, we have steady states at
        <m>p=3</m> and <m>p=6</m>. We label these points on the phase
        line. To determine the trajectories, we check the value of the
        right side of the equation between the steady states. 
        <tabular>
          <row>
            At <m>p=1</m>, the right side evaluates to 10, which is
            positive. The trajectory between 0 and 3 is upward. 
          </row>
          <row>
            At <m>p=4</m>, the right side evaluates to -2, which is
            negative. The trajectory between 3 and 6 is downward. 
          </row>
          <row>
            At <m>p=7</m>, the right side evaluates to 4, which is
            positive. The trajectory above 6 is upward. 
          </row>
        </tabular>
        This lets us classify the steady states. 
        <tabular>
          <row>
            The (imposed) steady state at 0 only has an trajectory
            pointing away, so this is an unstable steady state. 
          </row>
          <row>
            The steady state at 3 has trajectories pointing toward it,
            so it is a stable steady state.

        To calculate the phase line, we need the zeros of the right
        side of the equation. This is a cubic: we can try to look for
        the roots by inspection or as a computer for the roots. In an
        case, we find that <m>p=1</m>, <m>p=2</m> and <m>p=3</m> are
        the roots.  We label these points on the phase
        line. To determine the trajectories, we check the value of the
        right side of the equation between the steady states.

            At <m>p=\frac{1}{2}</m>, the right side evaluates to

            between 0 and 1 is downward.
          </row>

            At <m>p=\frac{3}{2}</m>, the right side evaluates to

        To calculate the phase line, we need the zeros of the right

        by inspection or by asking a computer. The roots are

        line. To determine the trajectories, we check the value of the

            The steady state at 4 has one trajectory pointing towards
            and one pointing away. This is neither stable or
            unstable; we can call it partially stable. If we want to
            be more specific, we can say that it is stable from below
            and unstable from above.
