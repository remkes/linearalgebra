    <title>Row Operations and Gaussian Elimination</title>
    <p>
      We defined three operations on systems of equations. Now that
      we have encoded systems as matrices, we need to understand the
      equivalent operations for matrices. Each equation in the system
      gives a row in the matrix; therefore, equation operations become
      row operations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply an equation by a non-zero constant
            <m>\implies</m> multiply a row by a non-zero constant.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change the order of the equations
            <m>\implies</m> exchange two rows of a matrix.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add (a multiple of) an equation to another equation
            <m>\implies</m>add (a multiple of) one row to another row.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the original operations didn't change the solution of a
      system of equations, the row operations on matrices also
      preserve the solution of the associated system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we need to know what a solution looks like in
      matrix form.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          This example shows the encoding of a direction solution.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The system has three columns before its vertical line,
          therefore it corresponds to a system of equation in
          <m>x,y,z</m>. If we translate this back into equations, we
          get the following system.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              x + 0y + 0z \amp  = -3
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              0z + y + 0z \amp  = -2
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              0x + 0y + z \amp  = 8
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing the zero terms gives <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and
          <m>z=8</m>. This equation delivers its solution directly:
          no work is necessary. We just read the solution off the
          page.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We have a name for the special form of a matrix where we can
      directly read the solutions of the associated linear system.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A matrix is a <term>reduced row-echelon</term> matrix, or is
          said to be in <term>reduced row-echelon form</term>, if the
          following things are true:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The first non-zero entry in each row is one. (A row
                entirely of zeros is fine). These entries are called
                leading ones.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Each leading one is in a column where all the other
                entries are zero.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We shall see that as long as an extended matrix is in reduced
      row-echelon form, we can always directly read off the solution
      to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing how to recognize solutions in matrix form and knowing
      the row operations, we can now state our matrix-based approach
      to solving linear systems. First, we to translate a system into
      a matrix. We then use row operations (which don't change the
      solution at all) to turn the matrix into reduced row-echelon
      form, where we can just read off the solution. Row operations
      will always be able to accomplish this.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The process of using row operations to change a matrix into
          reduced row echelon form is called <term>Guassian
          elimantion</term> or <term>row reduction</term>. This
          process proceeds in the following steps.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take a row which has a non-zero entry in the first
                column. (Often we exchange this row with the first, so
                that we are working on the first row).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Multiply by a constant to get a leading one in this
                row.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now that we have a leading one, we want to clear all
                the other entries in the first column. Thererfore, we
                add multiples of the row with the leading one to the
                other rows, one by one, to make those first column
                entries zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                That produces a column with a leading one in the first
                colum and sets all other first column entries zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Then we proceed to the next column and repeat the
                process all over again. Any column which is all zeros
                is skipped. Any row which is all zeros is also left
                alone.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
