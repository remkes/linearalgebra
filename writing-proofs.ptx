    <title>What Is A Proof</title>
    <p>
      In the sequence of courses that we offer at King's, the course
      on linear algera ia the most natural place to talk about
      mathematical proof. The material lends itself to a number of
      accessible proof examples and has a level of abstraction that
      suits proof questions. The linear algebra course also serves as
      a prerequisite for most of the other mathematic courses where
      proof becomes quite important, including the senior calculus
      courses, discrete mathematics, cryptography and theory of
      computing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is a mathematical proof? A simple definition is hard,
      but my best attempt is very general: a proof is a formal,
      logical mathematical argument that succeeds in convincing an
      informed reader. Let me talk through this definition.
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, a proof is an argument. It is persuasive: it has a
          proposition and it wants to convince its reader that the
          proposition is true. In this, it shares something with all
          the other arguments persuasions through the academy,
          including scientific studies, aethetic critiques, and
          persuasive essays.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, a proof is logical. Though mathematical discovery can
          happen in a variety of ways, the presentation of
          mathematical idea happens through logic. A proof will be a
          series of logical statements and implications. If
          successful, the chain of logic will lead from the
          assumptions of the proof to the desired conclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third, a proof is formal. Mathematical comes with formal
          notations, definition, and rules of manipulating
          expressions. A proof follows these formalities. It can't
          treat mathematical ideas and definition loosely <mdash /> it
          need to specifically and clearly use the construction
          provided by its assumptions and starting point. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, it succeeds in convincing its reader. At the end of
          a proof, the question should always be: are you convinced?
          Proof are accepted by the mathematical community when a
          sufficient number of qualified readers are convinced by the
          mathematical formality and logical sequence. In this course,
          when we study proof, I will try to repeatedly ask if you are
          convinced by the proof. If you are not, either the proof if
          flawed or you need to go back and study the assumptions,
          notations and structure more carefully.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>How to Write a Proof</title>
      <p>
        I desperately wish there were something simple and
        straightfoward I could say here about how to write a proof. I
        wish it could give you a reasonable three-step process which
        you could follow which would always provide good proofs.
        Unfortunately, no such thing exists. Writing proofs is the
        most difficult skill in mathematics. Writing a good proof is
        comparable to writing a good essay. Both tasks require a long
        process of reading lots of good examples and practicing the
        writing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, I'm not going to give you any short, easy
        method for writing proof (since, as I just said, no such
        method exists). Instead, I'm going to try to start the process
        of exposing you to proof. In many ways, we learn to write
        proof by example <mdash /> by reading lots of proofs and
        seeing how thye work. I'll show you a bunch of short proofs in
        this course and ask you to try to emulate them in the proofs I
        ask you to write in activities and assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I will give some pointers and ideas on how to
        start. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remember that a proof is a chain of logical arguments. You
          should see this structure in the proofs your write. Look out
          for any sudden jumps or gaps in the logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use your starting assumptions. If you are proving something
          about a prime number, but never use the fact that it is
          prime, something very strange is going on. Either you are
          making a mistake, or the assumption that the number is prime
          is unnecessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't assume what you are trying to prove. The statement
          that you want to prove should show up at the very end of
          your proof. You can't start with the statement you want to
          prove <mdash /> logical implications don't work that way.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a huge difference between the rough work that goes
          into sketching a proof and the final proof. In the rough
          work, we do often start with the conclusion and play around
          with idea to see how we might get their. We try things, play
          around with ideas, do test cases. But when we write up a
          proof, we take all this rough work and try to put in into
          a formal logical chain with the desired statement coming at
          the end, as a conclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          A good proof includes good writing as well as good
          mathematics. Write clear, complete sentence. Treat proof
          writing with the same level of care as you would any
          academic writing. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There are a number of special proof techniques that are
          worth some attention. I'll spend the next section on some of
          these techniques. Not all proofs need to any of these
          techniques, but they are common enough to point out at the
          start. 
        </li>
      </ul>

  <subsection xml-id="subsection-contradiction">
    <title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
    <p>
      There are many common structures and technique used in proof.
      I'm going to share with you two of the most common techniques.
      The first is proof by contraction. This technique relies on the
      assumption that any (well-formed) statement in mathematics is
      either true or false. To prove a statement is true, we can
      equivalently show that it is impossible for the statement to be
      false. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove by contradiction, we assume the statement we want to
      prove it false. Then, starting from that assumption, we make
      logical conclusions. These logical conclusions lead us to an
      impossible situation <mdash /> a contradiction. This
      contradiction can take many forms: a contradiction of some of
      statement we know is true; an impossibility of a statement
      being both true and false; or some other situation which cannot
      make sense. Since we end up with this contradiction, our
      original assumption must have been wrong. Since we assumed
      the statement was false, the fact that this assumption is wrong
      means the statement is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is perhaps easier to see in an example. I'll do two
      examples, both of which are classic proof examples. First, let's
      prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Step 1: Assume the statement is false. Here, the statement
        says there are infinitely many prime numbers. If that is
        false, there must be only finitely many prime numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Work from the assumption to build a contradiction. The
        assumption says that there are finitely many prime numbers.
        Let's index them: <m>p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots p_k</m>. Since
        there are only finitely many, this is a finite list of some
        length <m>k</m>. Then consider this very large number
        <me>
          m = p_1p_2 \ldots p_k + 1 
        </me>.
        What are the prime factors of this number? We know that all
        number break down uniquely into prime factors, so it must have
        prime factors. However, every prime number <m>p_i</m> in our
        list (which, by assumption is all prime numbers ) is a
        factor of <m>m-1</m>. A prime number can't be the factor of
        two consecutive numbers, so none of the prime numbers are
        factors of <m>m</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: State the contradictionl The number <m>m</m>must have
        prime factors, but cannot have prime factors, since none of
        the prime <m>p_i</m> are factors. This is a contradiction: the
        number both has and does not have prime factors. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Conclude that the original statement was false, which
        finishes the proof. The assumption that there were only
        finitely many prime number led to a contradiction. Therefore,
        by contradiction, we have proved that there are infinitely
        many prime numbers. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Another classic example is the proof that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is
      irrational. Let's also prove this by contradiction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Step 1: Assume the statement is false. The statement says that
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. If that is false, then
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> must be rational. Therefore, our assumption is
        that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Work from the assumption to build a contradiction. If
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational, then there are integer <m>a</m>
        and <m>b</m> such that <m>\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}</m>. Since
        any fraction can be written in simplest terms, we can assume
        that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common factors. Then I can
        do some arithmetic with this equation.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \sqrt{2} \amp = \frac{a}{b}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = \frac{a^2}{b^2} 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = a^2 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <m>2</m> divides the left side of the equation, so it must
        divide the right side as well, meaning that <m>a^2</m> must be
        even. But the square of odd numbers are odd, and of even
        numbers are even. Therefore, <m>a</m> must be even. We can
        write <m>a = 2c</m> for some integer <m>c</m>. Then I'll
        replace <m>a</m> by <m>2c</m> in the equation an do a bit more
        arithmetic. 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = a^2 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = (2c)^2 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2b^2 \amp = 4c^2 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            b^2 \amp = 2c^2 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        Now <m>2</m> divides the right side of the equation, so it
        must divide the right as well. That mean that <m>b^2</m> is
        even, so <m>b</m> must be even.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: State the contradiction. We assumed that <m>a</m>
        and <m>b</m> have no common factors, since we wrote the
        fraction in simplest terms. Now we have prove that both
        numbers are even, so <m>2</m> is a factor of both. This is a
        contradiction: <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common factors
        but <m>2</m> is a common factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Conclude that the original statement was false, which
        finishes the proof. The assumption that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> was
        rational lead to a contradiction, so we have proved that
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> must be irrational. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Proof by contradiction, as I mentioned at the start, relied on
      the assumption that any (well-formed) statement in mathematics
      is either true or false. That seems like a reasonable assumption
      in a logical system and proof by contradiction is an important
      tool in mainstream mathematics. However, some versions have
      mathematics have rejected this assumption. There are some
      versions of mathematics which do not allow proof by
      contradiction. (These are called intuitionistic or
      constructionist mathematics).

  <subsection xml-id="subsection-induction">
    <title>Proof by Induction</title>
      <p>
        Proof by induction is a method of proving statements that are
        true for all natural numbers. When there isn't a direct
        argument, statements such as these can be difficult to prove,
        since there are infinitely many natural numbers to check.
        Mathematician accept that the following process suffices.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prove a base case. (Usually, prove that the statement
          holds for <m>n=0</m> or <m>n=1</m>). 
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume that the statement is true for some number
          <m>k</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using that assumption, prove that the statement holds for
          the next number <m>k+1</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          Conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers
          <m>n</m>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This process is called mathematical induction. (This is really
        a terrible name. The reasoning here is still deductive
        reasoning, not inductive reasoning. Calling it induction
        really messing with the convention use of the term
        <qt>induction</qt> in logic). It is something like
        bootstrapping all the way up the natural numbers. We prove ti
        is true for <m>1</m>. Then we have a general way of proving
        that if it is true for a number, it is also true for the next
        number. Since it is true for <m>1</m>, it must be true for
        <m>2</m>. If it is true for <m>2</m>, it must be true for
        <m>3</m>. If it is true for <m>3</m>, it must be true for
        <m>4</m>. This just keeps going, so we conclude that it is
        true for all natural numbers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, this is probably best demonstrated by example. I claim
        that for any natural number <m>n \geq 1</m>, 
        <me>
          1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
        </me>.
        This is a nice identites giving us a way to quickly calculate
        the sum of the first <m>n</m> numbers. For example
        <me>
          1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + 703 = \frac{703\cdot704}{2} = 703
          \cdot 352 = 247,456
        </me>.
        By doing one division and one multiplication, I know the sum
        of the first <m>703</m> numbers. This is certainly much faster
        than doing <m>702</m> additions. Now let's use mathematical
        induction to prove this statement. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1: Prove the base case. The base case here is
          <m>n=1</m>. The left side is just <m>1</m>. The right side
          is <m>\frac{(1)(2)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1</m>. Since the left
          side and the right side are the same, the base case holds. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2: Assume this is true for <m>n=k</m> for some number
          <m>k</m>. I assume that 
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
          </me>
          is true for some number <m>n</m>. (Not every number, yet,
          just some number.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3: Prove the next case. I need to prove the statement
          is true for <m>n = k+1</m>. I can start with the assumption.
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
          </me>
          I can add <m>(k+1)</m> to both sides. 
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} +
            (k+1) 
          </me>
          Then I can do some arithmetic with the right side, starting
          with common demoninator. 
          <me>
            \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{k^2 + k + 2k + 1}{2} =
            \frac{k^2 + 3k + 1} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2}{2} =
            \frac{(k+1)(k+1+1)}{2}
          </me>
          Now I'll replace the right side with this last expression.
          <me>
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+1+1)}{2}
          </me>
          Finally, I can observe that this right side is precisely the
          desired equation with <m>n = k+1</m>. I have prove the next
          case. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Since I have a base case, and I know that each base implies
          the following case, I conclude (by mathematical induction)
          that the statement holds for all natural numbers. 
        </li>
      </ul>
