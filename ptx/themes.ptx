  <title>Themes of the Course</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>Algebra</title>
    <p>
      Linear <em>algebra</em> is, as expected, an algebra course.
      (It is the only strictly algebra course taught at King's, though elsewhere,
      it would be the first of a sequence of algebra courses.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The word <sq>algebra</sq> does not mean the same thing in university mathematics as it did in high-school mathematics.
      Previously, the world <sq>algebra</sq> usually signaled the use of variables:
      <m>3+5 = 8</m> is arithmetic,
      but <m>3 + x = 8 \implies x = 5</m> is algebra.
      From that point, algebra became the manipulation of equations
      (and inequalities)
      with variables,
      particularly focusing on solving polynomials and rational functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In academic mathematics, algebra has a much broader and deeper sense.
      It is a whole branch of mathematics, with many subdisciplines:
      linear algebra, abstract algebra, homological algebra, etc.
      One of the goals of this course will be to build as sense of what we mean by the term <sq>algebra</sq>.
      I'll give a definition right now,
      at the start, but it's a difficult definition to understand;
      hopefully the course will provide the necessary elaboration.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <term>Algebra</term> is the study of sets with structure.
          It investigates possible structures on sets,
          the rules obeyed by those structures,
          and the interaction of various structures.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="abstraction">
    <title>Abstraction</title>
    <p>
      The definition of algebra just stated is an immensely abstract definition.
      I haven't specified what sets or what structures I'm talking about. (I could say that we are looking at
      <em>algebraic structures</em>,
      but that doesn't actually add any insight;
      it just delays the question.) The definition is very broad,
      applies to a huge variety of sets and structures.
      Abstraction is built into the very nature of algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the calculus courses, I often motivate the material by its applications.
      (The two most often used motivations are the Newtonian physics and percentage growth in ecology or finance.)
      In this sense, I'm treating the calculus as applied mathematics:
      mathematics driven by and designed for the solving of certain extra-mathematical problems.
      This is a reasonable approach for calculus,
      both for historical and pedagogical reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this course,
      there will be points where I emphasize the practical applications of linear algebra,
      of which there are many.
      However, my primary motivation for the course will be intrinsic and abstract: I want to study sets and their structure simply for the mathematical joy of it.
      This is the one course at King's which is most suited to presenting the goals and ideas of abstract mathematics,
      in and of themselves.

  <subsection xml:id="geometry-theme">
    <title>Geometry</title>
    <p>
      Though the subjet is called <sq>algebra</sq>,
      linear algebra is a very geometric discpline.
      Given my background as a geometer,
      my approach to the course will be heavily geometric.
      We will start with vectors,
      which is a geometric discpline,
      though it has rich algebraic structre.
      Throughout the course,
      we will play the geometry and algebra against each other and use each to understand the other better.
      This interplay drives the discpline.
      In many ways,
      this will be a geomety course hiding under the title of an algebra course.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition,
      we will not restrict ourselves for conventional two and three dimensional geometry.
      The definitions of this course are very general,
      so we will try to do geometry in any (finite) dimension.
      A major challenge of the course is going from familiar,
      visible three dimensions to un-visualizable higher dimensional geometry.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="flatness">
    <title>Flatness</title>
    <p>
      While a geometry course,
      the geometry we are considering will be very restricted.
      The <sq>linear</sq> in linear algebra refers to lines,
      so we will start with the geometry of lines.
      However, the important property of a line,
      in our context, is the fact that it is straight: it doesn't curve.
      Linear algebra is the geomtery of flat things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, curved, bent and broken objects are off limits.
      We will investigate the geometry of flat objects:
      points, lines, planes and higher dimensional analogue.
      A great advantage of this restriction is the fact that flat things are very accessable.
      The geometry of curved objects is an immensely complicated and difficult subject.
      By restricting to flat objects,
      we can produce a wide range of accessible mathematical results.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="symmetry">
    <title>Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Other than flatness, our other major geometric theme is symmetry.
      Many of the definitions and propositions produced in this course can be stated in terms of some kind of symmetry.
      Speaking broadly, I want to thing of symmetry as preservation:
      the symmetry of a shape is some kind of operation which keeps the shape intact,
      preserves it.
      Throughout linear algebra,
      we will be talking about the preservation of various kinds of shapes and flat objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the interplay between algebra and geometry mentioned above,
      we will also translate this idea of symmetry back to algebra to give a understanding of algebraic symmetry.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="proof">
    <title>Proof</title>
    <p>
      Proofs are another major difference between the grade-school understanding of algebra and the academic sense of the word.
      Algebra is originally introduced to solve problems involving unknown quantities,
      usually by solving equations.
      Algebra is a problem-solving technique.
      In academic mathematics,
      we are usually more concerned with conjectures about mathematical objects and the proofs of those conjecture.
      In this course, we'll introduce the idea of conjectures,
      propositions, theorems and proofs.
      We'll do a small amount of proving on the assignments to build a flavour for proof-based mathematics.
