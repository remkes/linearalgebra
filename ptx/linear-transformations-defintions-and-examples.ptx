    <p>
      After a good definition of the environment (<m>\RR^n</m>) and its objects (lines,
      planes, hyperplanes, etc),
      the next mathematical step is to understand the functions that live in the environment and affect its objects.
      First, we need to generalize the simple notion of a function to linear spaces.
      In algebra and calculus, we worked with functions of real numbers.
      These functions are rules <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> which go between subsets of real numbers.
      The function <m>f</m> assigns to each <em>number</em>
      in <m>A</m> a unique <em>number</em> in <m>B</m>.
      They include the very familiar <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
      <m>f(x) = \sin (x)</m>, <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and many others.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be subsets of <m>\RR^n</m> and <m>\RR^m</m>,
          respectively.
          A <term>function</term> between linear spaces is a rule
          <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> which assigns to each <term>vector</term>
          in A a unique <term>vector</term> in <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can define a function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^3</m> by <m>f\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x^2\\y^2\\z^2 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Another function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^2</m> could be <m>f\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x-y\\z-y \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>linear function</term> or
          <term>linear transformation</term>
          from <m>\RR^n</m> to <m>\RR^m</m> is a function
          <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> such that for two vectors
          <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m> and any scalar <m>a \in \RR</m>,
          the function must obey two rules.
          <md>
            <mrow>f(u+v) \amp  = f(u) + f(v)</mrow>
            <mrow>f(au) \amp  = af(u)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Informally, we say that the function <term>respects</term>
          the two main operations on linear spaces:
          addition of vectors and multiplication by scalars.
          If we perform addition before or after the function, we get the same result.
          Likewise for scalar multiplication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      By inspection and testing,
      one could determined that the first example above fails these two rules,
      but the second example satisfies them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This definition creates to the restrictive but important class of linear functions.
      We could easily define linear algebra as a study of these transformations.
      There is an alternative and equivalent definition of linear transformation.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> is linear if and only if it sends linear objects to linear objects.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Under a linear transformation points, lines,
      planes are changed to other points, lines, planes, etc.
      A line can't be bent into an arc or broken into two different lines.
      Hopefully, some of the major ideas of the course are starting to fit together:
      the two basic operations of addition and scalar multiplication give rise to spans,
      which are flat objects.
      Linear transformation preserve those operations,
      so they preserve flat objects.
      Exactly <em>how</em> they change these objects can be tricky to determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, because of scalar multiplication,
      if we take <m>a = 0</m> we get that <m>f(0) = 0</m>.
      Under a linear transformation,
      the origin is always sent to the origin.
      So, in addition to preserving flat objects,
      linear transformation can't move the origin.
      We could drop this condition of preserving the origin to get another class of functions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>affine transformation</term>
          from <m>\RR^n</m> to <m>\RR^m</m> is a transformation that preserves affine subspaces.
          These transformations preserve flat objects but may move the origin.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Though they are interesting,
      we don't spend much time with affine transformations.
      They can always be realized as a linear transformation combined with a shift or displacement of the entire space by a fixed vector.
      Since shifts are relatively simple,
      we can usually reduce problems of affine transformations to problems of linear transformations.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="composition">
    <title>Composition</title>
    <p>
      Once we understood functions of real numbers,
      we learned to compose them.
      We do the same for linear transformations.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> and
          <m>g: \RR^m \rightarrow \RR^l</m> be linear transformations.
          Then <m>g \circ f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^l</m> is the linear transformation formed by first applying <m>f</m> and then <m>g</m>.
          Note that the <m>\RR^m</m> has to match:
          <m>f</m> outputs to <m>\RR^m</m>,
          which is the input for <m>g</m>.
          Also note that the notation is written right-to-left: In <m>g \circ f</m>,
          the transformation <m>f</m> happens first, followed by <m>g</m>.
          This new transformation is called the <term>composition</term>
          of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="transformations-r2">
    <title>Linear Transformations of <m>\RR^2</m></title>
    <p>
      It is useful for us to specialize to transformations <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR^2</m>,
      in order to build experience and intuition.
      As we noted above, linear transformations preserve flat objects.
      What can we do to <m>\RR^2</m> that preserves lines and preserves the origin?
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are five basic types of linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Rotations</em> about the origin
          (either clockwise or counter-clockwise)
          preserve lines.
          We can't rotate around any other point,
          since that would move the origin.
          Since we can choose any angle,
          there are infinitely many such rotations.
          Also, since rotating by <m>\theta</m> radians clockwise is the same as
          <m>2\pi - \theta</m> radians counter-clockwise,
          we typically choose to only deal with counter-clockwise rotations.
          Counter-clockwise rotations are considered positive and clockwise rotations are considered negative.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Reflections</em> over lines through the origin preserve lines.
          The line of refleciton must passthrough the origin or else the reflection will move the origin.
          Since there are infinitely many different lines through the origin,
          there are infinitely many such reflections.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Skews</em> are a little tricker to visualize.
          A skew is a transformation that takes either veritcal or horizontal lines
          (but not both)
          and tilts them diagonally.
          It changes squares into parallelograms.
          The tilted lines are still lines,
          so it is a linear transformation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Dialations</em> are transformation which stretch or shink in various directions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Projections</em> are transformations which collapse <m>\RR^2</m> down to a line through the origin.
          Two important examples are projection onto either axis.
          Projection onto the <m>x</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m> to <m>(a,0)</m>,
          removing the <m>y</m> component.
          Likewise, projection onto the <m>y</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m> to <m>(0,b)</m>,
          removing the <m>x</m> component.
          In a similar manner,
          we can project onto any line though the origin by sending each point to the closest point on the line.
          Finally, there is the projection to the origin which sends all points to the origin.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We present the following interesting theorem without proof.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> are generated by composition of transformations of the previous five types.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="transformations-r3">
    <title>Linear Transformations of <m>\RR^3</m></title>
    <p>
      We can also specialize to transformations of <m>\RR^3</m>,
      though it is not as easy to give a complete account of the basic types.
      However, all of the types listed for <m>\RR^2</m> generalize.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Rotations in <m>\RR^3</m> are no longer about the origin.
            Instead, we have to choose an axis.
            Any line through the origin will do for an axis of rotation.
            Any rotation in <m>\RR^3</m> is determined by an axis of rotation and an angle of rotation about that axis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reflections are also altered:
            instead of reflecting over a line,
            we have to reflect over a plane through the origin.
            Any plane through the origin determines a reflection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Skews are similarly defined:
            one or two directions are fixed and the remaining directions are tilted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Dialations are also similar,
            though we have three possible axis directions in which to stretch or compress.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Like <m>\RR^2</m>, we can project onto the origin,
            sending everything to zero, or onto a line,
            sending every point to the closest point on a line.
            Examples include projection onto the axes.
            However, we can also project onto planes.
            Sending <m>(a,b,c)</m> to <m>(a,b,0)</m>, for example,
            removes the <m>z</m> coordinate;
            this is projection onto the <m>xy</m> plane.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="transformations-symmetry">
    <title>Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Notice that we've defined linear functions by the objects and/or properties they preserve.
      This is a very general technique in mathematics.
      Very frequently, functions are classified by what they preserve.
      As discussed in the very first chapter,
      we use the word <sq>symmetry</sq> to describe this perspective:
      the symmetries of a function are the objects or algebraic properties preserved by the function.
      A function exhibits more symmetry if it preserves more objects or more properties.
      The conventional use of symmetry in English relates more to a shape than a function:
      what are the symmetries of a hexagon?
      We can connect the two ideas:
      asking for the symmetries of the hexagon can be thought of as asking for the transformations of <m>\RR^2</m> that preserve a hexagon.
      This is a bit of a reverse:
      the standard usage of the word talks about transformation as the symmetries of a shape.
      Here we start with a transformation and talk about the shape as a symmetry of the transformation:
      the hexagon is a symmetry of rotation by one sixth of a full turn.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="dihedral-groups">
    <title>Dihedral Groups</title>
    <p>
      The case of regular polygons,
      such as the hexagon, is a very useful place for us to start.
      Transformations which do not preserve flat objects may not going to preserve the edges of the polygons.
      Therefore, we want to know which linear transformations preserve the regular polygons.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>Dihedral Group</term> is the group of linear symmetries of a regular polygon.
          If the polygon has <m>n</m> edges,
          then we write <m>D_n</m> for the associated dihedral group.
          Thus, <m>D_3</m> is the group of symmetries of the triangle,
          <m>D_4</m> is the group of symmetries of the square,
          <m>D_5</m> is the group of symmetries of the pentagon,
          and so on.
          (Some texts use <m>D_{2n}</m> instead of <m>D_n</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's first consider the square.
          For all the polygons we are considering,
          we assume the origin is at the centre of the polygon.
          We can assume the square has vertices <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>,
          <m>(-1,-1)</m> and <m>(-1,1)</m>.
          Conveniently, the vertices are all we need to think about:
          since linear transformations preserve lines,
          if we know where the vertices go,
          then we know that the lines connecting them are preserved and hence the shape is preseved.
          Which transformations preserve the vertices?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two relatively obvious classes that might occur to us.
          First, there are rotation about the origin.
          If we rotate by <m>\pi/2</m> radians (a quarter turn),
          the vertices are preserved.
          Likewise for rotations by <m>\pi</m> and <m>3\pi/2</m> radians.
          If we are really paying attention,
          we might also think of rotation by <m>2\pi</m> radians,
          a full turn.
          This might seem silly, but the identity transformation
          (the transformation that leaves everything fixed)
          is a very important transformation and should be included in the list.
          So, for now, we have the identity and three rotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might also think about reflections.
          Looking at the square, we can find four lines of reflection:
          the <m>x</m>-axs, the <m>y</m>-axis,
          the line <m>x=y</m> and the line <m>x=-y</m>.
          That brings the total number of transformation to eight:
          the identity, three rotations, and four reflections.
          These eight are, in face, the complete group.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that we used the work <sq>group</sq> instead of <sq>set</sq> to describe this collection.
      <sq>Group</sq> is a technical word in mathematics,
      refering to a set with some extra properties.
      We won't go into the formal details,
      but we'll use the dihedral groups as archetypical examples.
      There are three properties of the dihedral groups which hold for all groups.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The composition of two elements of the group is still in the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The identity transformation is in the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The inverse operation of any group element is still a group element.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we haven't formally defined inverses,
      the third property is not to hard to see for the dihedral groups.
      For the reflections,
      if we perform the reflection again we get back to where we started.
      The reflections are their own inverses.
      For rotations,
      we add another rotation so that we have completed a full turn.
      The inverse of rotation by <m>\pi/2</m> radians is rotation by <m>3\pi/2</m> radians.
      Equivalently, the inverse is rotation by <m>-\pi/2</m> radians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first property is a little trickier.
      We leave it to you to try out some compositions of rotations and reflections to see how the result is still one of the eight symmetries.
      Likewise, we leave it to you to extend this analysis of <m>D_4</m> to other diheadral groups:
      <m>D_3</m>, <m>D_5</m>, <m>D_6</m> and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All dihedral groups are composed of the identity,
      some rotations, and some reflections.
      <m>D_4</m> is a useful enough example that we should fix notation.
      I or <m>\Id</m> is the identity transformation,
      <m>R_1</m> is rotation by <m>\pi/2</m> radians,
      <m>R_2</m> is rotation by <m>\pi</m>radians and <m>R_3</m> is rotation by <m>3\pi/2</m> radians.
      <m>F_1</m> is reflection over the <m>x</m> axis,
      <m>F_2</m> over <m>x=y</m>,
      <m>F_3</m> over the <m>y</m> axis and <m>F_4</m> over <m>y=-x</m>.
    </p>
