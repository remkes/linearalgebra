    <title>Pedagogical Model</title>
    <p>
      This courses uses a pedagogical model known either as blended learning or the flipped classroom.
      In this model,
      the majority of the content will be delivered outside of class time through two avenues:
      these notes and a series of short videos.
      You will be required to watch one of the short videos before most class periods.
      We will begin each lecture period assuming you have watched the required video.
    </p>
    <p>
      The videos are used to introduce the main ideas of the course.
      They are the explanation.
      Matched with each video will be a short section of notes.
      The notes are provided for reference,
      so that after you've watched the video,
      you can use the notes to remind yourself of the content and refer to useful ideas,
      concepts and formulae.
      The notes are not primarily written to explain the material;
      instead, they are written to provide a record of the ideas in the video for your reference.
      The notes are light on examples.
      The lecture time will be mostly devoted to necessary practice and examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course is organized into twenty-two lectures;
      the videos and the activities are numbered to match these lectures.
      There is a detailed schedule on the course website showing when the various lectures happen over the term.
      Please use this schedule to ensure you watch the appropriate videos before class and bring the appropriate sections of the notes.

    <title>Other Resources</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the notes associated to each lecture,
      there are a number of other resources which are distributed via the course website.
      These resources have been developed to assist you,
      so please make use of them.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A complete formula sheet.
            All of the basic formulas and rules for calculation are included on this sheet.
            There are sections on algebra,
            trigonometry, derivatives and integrals.
            Later in the document are some pieces of linear algebra reference as well.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A notation reference.
            This reference covers a number of notations used in the course which may be unfamiliar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A course outcomes sheet.
            This was originally developed as a study aid for students.
            It summarizes the main definitions and concepts of the course,
            as well as the types of questions your will encounter on assignments and exams.
            In particular, it gives a guide to the material on the exam.
            If you want to know whether a definition,
            topic or type of problem might show up on the exam, consult this sheet.
          </p>

    <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I will try to share some ideas which give perspective and context to mathematics.
      This include the philosophy of mathematics,
      the aesthetics of mathematics,
      and how our own worldview and assumptions influence mathematical thought.
      Linear algebra is perhaps the most abstract mathematical course offered at King's;
      at least, it offers the most oppotunity for abstract thinking.
      Therefore, I use this course as a venue for talking about abstraction in the context of perspectives and philosophy.
