      The previous eight chapters introduced the geometric side of this course.
      This chapter changes perspective to look at the algebraic side of linear algebra.
      A major problem in algebra is solving systems of equations:
      given several equations in several variables,
      can we find values for each variable which satisfy all the equations?
      In general, algegra considers any kind of equation.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <md>
          <mrow>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \amp  = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>xy + 2xz - 3yz \amp  = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x+y+z \amp  = 3</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          This system is solved by <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . When substitued in the equations,
          these values satisfy all three.
          No other triples satisfies, so this is a unique solution.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      Solving arbitrary systems of equations is a very difficult problem.
      There are two initial techniques,
      which are usually taught in high-school mathematics:
      isolating and replacing variables;
      or performing arithmetic with the equations themselves.
      Both are useful techniques.
      However, when the equations become quite complicated, both methods can fail.
      In that case,
      solutions to systerms can only be approached with approximation methods.
      The methodology of these approximations is a whole branch of mathematics in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are going to restrict ourselves to a class of systems which is more approchable:
      systems of linear equations.
      Recall the definition of a linear equation.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_i</m>,
          for <m>i \in \{1, \ldots n\}</m> and <m>c</m> be real numbers.
          A <term>linear equation</term> in the variables
          <m>x_1, x_2 \ldots,
          x_n</m> is a equation of the following form.
          <me>
            a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Given a fixed set of variables
      <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots,
      x_n</m>, we want to consider systems of linear equations
      (and only linear equations)
      in those variables.
      While much simpler than the general case,
      linear systems are a common and useful type of system to consider.
      Such systems also work well with arithmetic solution techniques,
      since we can add two linear equations together and still have a linear equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This turns out to be the key idea:
      we can do arithmetic with linear equations.
      Specifically,
      there are three things we can do with a system of linear equation.
      These three techniques <em>preserve the solutions</em>, that is,
      they don't alter the values of the variables that solve the system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiple a single equation by a (non-zero) constant. (Multiplying both sides of the equation,
            of course).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change the order of the equations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add one equation to another.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we combine the first and third,
      we could restate the third as:
      add a multiple of one equation to another.
      In practice, we often think of the third operation this way.

    <title>Matrices</title>
    <p>
      If we worked with the equations directly, we would find,
      with careful application of the three techniques,
      we could always solve linear systems.
      However, the notation becomes cumbersome for large systems.
      Therefore, we introduce a method to encode the information in a nicely organized way.
      This method takes the coefficients of the linear equations in a system and puts them in a rectangular box called a matrix.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of scalars.
          If the matrix has <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns,
          we say it is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.
          The scalars in the matrix are called the <term>entries</term>,
          <term>components</term> or <term>coefficients</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The rows of a matrix are called the
          <term>row vectors</term> of the matrix.
          Likewise the columns are called
          <term>column vectors</term> of the matrix.
        </p>
      </statement>

      A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers,
      enclosed either in square or round brackets.
      Here are two ways of writing a particular
      <m>3\times 2</m> matrix with integer coefficients.
      <men>
        \left( \begin{matrix} 5 \amp  6 \\ -4 \amp  -4 \\ 0 \amp  -3 \end{matrix} \right) \hspace{2cm} \left[ \begin{matrix} 5 \amp  6 \\ -4 \amp  -4 \\ 0 \amp  -3 \end{matrix} \right]
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      The rows of this matrix are the following three vectors.
      <men>
        \begin{pmatrix}5\\6\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} \begin{pmatrix}-4\\-4\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} \begin{pmatrix}0\\-3\end{pmatrix}
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      The columns of this matrix are the following two vectors.
      <men>
        \begin{pmatrix}5\\-4\\0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} \begin{pmatrix}6\\-4\\-3\end{pmatrix}
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      In these notes, we'll use curved brackets for matrices;
      however, in many texts and books,
      square brackets are very common.
      Both notations are conventional and acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to write a general matrix,
      we can use a double subscript.
      <men>
        \left( \begin{array}{cccc} a_{11} \amp  a_{12} \amp  \ldots \amp  a_{1n} \\ a_{21} \amp  a_{22} \amp  \ldots \amp  a_{2n} \\ \ldots \amp  \ldots \amp  \ldots \amp  \ldots \\ a_{n1} \amp  a_{n2} \amp  \ldots \amp  a_{nn} \end{array} \right)
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      By convention,
      when we write an aribitrary matrix entry <m>a_{ij}</m> the first subscript tells us the row and the second subscript tells us the column.
      For example,
      <m>a_{64}</m> is the entry in the sixth row and the fourth column.
      In the rare occurence that we have matrices with more than 10 rows or columns,
      we can seperate the indices by commas:
      <m>a_{12,15}</m> would be in the twelfth row and the fifteenth column.
      Sometime we write <m>A = a_{ij}</m> as short-hand for the entire matrix when the size is understood or undetermined.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>square matrix</term> is a matrix with the same number of rows as columns.
          Here are two examples.
          <men>
            \left( \begin{matrix} 4 \amp  -2 \amp  8 \\ -3 \amp  -3 \amp  -3 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \end{matrix} \right) \hspace{2cm} \left( \begin{matrix} 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  0 \end{matrix} \right)

    </definition>

          The <term>zero matrix</term> is the unique matrix (one for every size
          <m>m \times n)</m> where all the coefficients are all zero.
          <men>
            \left( \begin{matrix} 0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \end{matrix} \right) \hspace{2cm} \left( \begin{matrix} 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \end{matrix} \right)

      The columns represent the hidden variables.
      In the examples above,

      the second is the <m>y</m> column,
