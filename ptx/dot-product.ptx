    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      Earlier we said that we can't multiply two vectors together.
      That's mostly true,
      in the sense that there is no general product of two vectors <m>uv</m> which is still a vector.
      However, there are other kinds of <sq>multiplication</sq> which combine two vectors.
      The operation defined in this lecture multiplies two vectors,
      but the result is a scalar.

          The <term>dot product</term> or
          <term>inner product</term>
          or <term>scalar product</term>
          of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
          <me>
            u \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\end{pmatrix} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \ldots + u_n v_n

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We can think of the dot product as a scalar measure of the similarity of direction between the two vectors.
      If the two vectors point in a similar direction,
      their dot product is large,
      but if they point in very different directions,
      their dot product is small.
      However, we already have a measure,
      at least in <m>\RR^2</m>, of this difference:
      the angle between two vectors.
      Thankfully, the two measures of difference agree and the dot product can be expressed in terms of angles.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>angle</term> <m>\theta</m> between two non-zero vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is given by the equation
          <me>
            \cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition agrees with the angles in <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> which we can visualize.
      However, this serves as a new definition for angles between vectors in all <m>\RR^n</m> when <m>n \geq 4</m>.
      Since we can't visualize those spaces,
      we don't have a way of drawing angles and calculating them with conventional trigonometry.
      This definition allows us to extend angles in a completely algebraic way.
      Notes that <m>\theta \in [0, \pi]</m>,
      since we always take the smallest possible angle between two vectors.

          Two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> are called
          <term>orthogonal</term> or
          <term>perpendicular</term>
          or <term>normal</term> if <m>u \cdot v = 0</m>.

    <title>Properties of the Dot Product</title>
    <p>
      There are many pairs of orthogonal vectors.
      Thinking of the dot product as a multiplication,
      we have uncovered a serious difference between the dot product and conventional multiplication of numbers.
      If <m>a,b\in \RR</m> then <m>ab=0</m> implies that one of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> must be zero.
      For vectors,
      we can have <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> <m>= 0</m> even though neither factor in the product is the zero vector.
      We have a definition to keep track of this new property.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume <m>A</m> is a set with addition and some kind of multiplication and that <m>0 \in A</m>.
          If <m>u \neq 0</m> and <m>\neq 0</m> but <m>uv =0</m>,
          we say that <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are
          <term>zero divisors</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      An important property of ordinary numbers,
      as we just noted, is that there are no zero divisors.
      Other algebraic structures,
      such as vectors with the dot product,
      may have many zero divisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have a new operation,
      it is useful to see how it interact with previously defined structure.
      The following list shows some interactions between addition,
      scalar multiplication, length and the dot product.
      Some of these are easy to establish from the definition and some take more work.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u,v,w</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> and let <m>a</m> be a scalar in <m>\RR</m>.
          <men>
            \begin{array}{rll} u + v \amp  = v + u \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Commutative Law for Vector Addition }  \\ a (u+v) \amp  = au + av \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Distributive Law for Scalar Multiplication } \\ u \cdot v \amp  = v \cdot u \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Commutative Law for the Dot Product } \\ u \cdot u \amp  = |u|^2 \amp  \\ u \cdot (v+w) \amp  = u \cdot v + u \cdot w \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Distributive Law for the Dot Product } \\ u \cdot (av) \amp  = (au) \cdot v = a (u \cdot v) \end{array}
          </men>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^2</m>,
      norms and dot products allow us to recreate some well-known geometric constructions.
      For example, now that we have lengths and angles,
      we can state the cosine law in terms of vectors.
      The visualization of the vector relationships of the cosine law is shown in <xref ref="the-cosine-law">Figure</xref>.
