  <title>Polyhedra in <m>\RR^n</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we have defined vectors,
      we want to investigate more complicated objects in <m>\RR^n</m>.
      The major objects for the course work
      (linear and affine subspaces)
      will be defined in the coming lectures.
      In this lecture, however,
      we take a short detour to discover how familiar shapes and solids extend into higher dimensions.
      I'll use the standard term <em>polyhedron</em>
      (plural polyhedra)
      to refer to a straight-edged objects in any <m>\RR^n</m>.
      First, however, we start with a familiar without straight edges.

  <subsection xml:id="spheres">
    <title>Spheres</title>
    <p>
      Spheres are, in some way, the easiest objects to generalize.
      Spheres are all things in <m>\RR^n</m> which are exactly one unit of distance from the origin.
      The <sq>sphere</sq> in <m>\RR</m> is just the points <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
      The <sq>sphere</sq> in <m>\RR^2</m> is the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.
      The sphere in <m>\RR^3</m> is the conventional sphere,
      with equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1</m>.
      The sphere in <m>\RR^4</m> has equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1</m>.
      The sphere in <m>\RR^n</m> has equation <m>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 = 1</m>.
      For dimensional reasons,
      since spheres are usually considered hollow objects,
      the sphere in <m>\RR^n</m> is called the <m>(n-1)</m>-sphere.
      That means the circle is the 1-sphere and the conventional sphere is the 2-sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sphere relate to the lower dimension spheres by looking at slices.
      Any slice of a sphere produces a circle.
      Likewise, any slice of a 3-sphere produces a 2-sphere.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="simplices">
    <title>Simplicies</title>
    <p>
      The simplex is the simplest straight-line polyhedra.
      I'll define them without specifying their vector definition in <m>\RR^n</m>,
      since that definition is slightly more technical than necessary.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 1-simplex is a line segment.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 2-simplex is an equilateral triangle.
            It is formed from the 1-simplex by adding one new vertex and drawing edges to the existing vertex such that all edges have the same length.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 3-simplex is a tetrahedron
            (or triangular pyramid).
            Again, it is formed by adding one new vertex in a new direction and drawing lines to all existing vertices such that all line
            (new and old)
            have the same length.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            This process extends into higher dimensions.
            In each stage a new vertex is added in the new direction and edges connect it to all previous vertices,
            such that all edges have the same length.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="cross-polytopes">
    <title>Cross-Polytopes</title>
    <p>
      Another family of regular solids which extends to all dimensions is the cross-polytopes.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^2</m>,
            the cross-polytope is the diamond with vertices <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , and <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . In each dimension,
            two vertices are added at <m>\pm 1</m> in the new axis direction,
            and edges are added connecting the two new vertices to each existing vertex (but the two new vertices are not connected to each other)..
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^3</m>, the cross-polytope is the octahedron,
            with vertices <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , and <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> .
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In higher dimensions,
            the vertices are all vectors with <m>\pm 1</m> in one component and zero in all other components.
            Each vertex is connected to all other vertices except its opposite.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="cubes">
    <title>Cubes</title>
    <p>
      Finally, we have the family of cubes.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <sq>cube</sq> n <m>\RR</m> is the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
            It can be defined by the inequality
            <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m> for <m>x \in \RR</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^2</m>,
            the <sq>cube</sq> is the just the ordinary (solid) square.
            It is all vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> such that
            <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1</m>.
            The square can be formed by taking two intervals and connecting the matching vertices.
            It has four vertices and four edges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In <m>\RR^3</m>, the square object is the (solid) cube.
            It is all vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , such that each coordinate is in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
            It can also be seen as two squares with matching vertices connected.
            Two square gives eight vertices.
            Eight square edges plus four connecting edges gives the twelve edges of the cube.
            It also has six square faces.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then we can simply keep extending.
            In <m>\RR^4</m>,
            the set of all vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> where all coordinates are in the interal <m>[0,1]</m> is called the hypercube or 4-cube.
            It can be seen as two cubes with pairwise edges connected.
            The cubes each have eight vertices,
            so the 4-cubes has sixteen vertices.
            Each cube has 12 edges, and their are 8 new connecting edges,
            so the 4-cube has 32 edges.
            It has 24 faces and 8 cells.
            A cell (or 3-face) here is a three dimensional <sq>edge</sq> of a four
            (or higher)
            dimensional object.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There is an <m>n</m>-cube in each <m>\RR^n</m>,
            consisting of all vectors where all components are in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
            Each can be constructed by joining two copies of a lower dimensional <m>(n-1)</m>-cube with edges between matching vertices.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="other-solids">
    <title>Other Platonic Solics</title>
    <p>
      A regular polyhedron is one where all edges, faces, cells,
      n-cells are the same size/shape and,
      in addition, the angles between all the edges, faces, cells,
      n-cells are also the same whever the various objects meet.
      In addition,
      the polyhedron is called convex if all angles are greater that <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians.
      The study of convex regular polyhedra is an old and celebrated part of mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^2</m>,
      there are infinitely many convex regular polyhedra:
      the regular polygons with any number of sides.
      In <m>\RR^3</m>, in addition to the cube,
      tetrahedron and octahedron, there are only two others:
      the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.
      These were well known to the ancient Greeks and are called the
      <em>Platonic Solids</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three families (cube,
      tetrahedron, cross-polytope) extend to all dimensions,
      but the dodecahedron and icoahedron are particular to <m>\RR^3</m>.
      It is a curious and fascinating question to ask what other special,
      unique convex regular polyhedra occur in higher dimesions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^4</m>, there are three others.
      They are called the 24-cell, the 120-cell and 600-cell,
      named for the number of 3-dimensional cells they contain
      (the same way the 4-cubes contains 8 3-cubes).
      The 24-cell is built from 24 octahedral cells.
      The 120-cell is built from dodecahedral cells and the 600-cell is built from tetrahedral cells.
      The 120-cell, in some ways,
      extends the dodecahedron and the 600-cell extends the icosahedron.
      The 24-cell is unique to <m>\RR^4</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an amazing theorem of modern mathematics that in dimensions higher than <m>4</m>,
      there are no regular polyhedra other than the three families.
      Neither the icosahedron nor the dodecahedron extend,
      and there are no other erratic special polyhedra found in any higher dimension.
