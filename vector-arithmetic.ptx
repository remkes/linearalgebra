    <title>Linear Operations</title>
    <p>
      The environment for linear algebra is <m>\RR^n</m>. Algebra is
      concerned with operations on sets, so we want to know what
      operations we can perform on <m>\RR^n</m>. There are several.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>sum</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in
          <m>\RR^n</m> is the sum taken componentwise..
          <me>
            u + v = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\
            v_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2
            \\ \vdots \\ u_n + v_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The sum is visuzliazed by placing the start of the second vector
      at the end of the first, as in <xref
      ref="figure-visualizing-vector-addition" />. Note that we
      can only add two vectors in the same dimension. We can't add a
      vector in <m>\RR^2</m> to a vector in <m>\RR^3</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u</m> is a vector in <m>\RR^n</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m>
          is a real number, then the <term>scalar
          multiplication</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>a</m> is
          multiplication by <m>a</m> in each component of <m>u</m>.
          By convention, scalar multiplication is written with the
          scalar on the left of the vector.
          <me>
            au = a \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} au_1 \\ au_2 \\ \vdots \\
            au_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Though there will be other <sq>multiplications</sq> to come, we
      generally say that we can't multiply vectors together in any way
      reminiscent of numbers. Instead, we can only multiply by
      scalars. Scalar multiplication is visualizing by scaling the
      vector by the value of the scalar. (Hence the term
      <sq>scalar</sq>!) If the scalar is negative, the direction is
      also reversed, as in <xref
      ref="figure-visualizing-scalar-multiplication" />.

    <p>
      Scalar multiplication also lets us define the difference between
      vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The difference between two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          the vector <m>u + (-1)v</m>, defined using addition and
          scalar multiplication. This works out to be componentwise
          subtraction.
          <me>
            u - v = u + (-1) v= \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots
            \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} + (-1) \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\
            \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_ 1\\
            u_2 - v_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n - v_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          With respect to some set of scalars (such as <m>\RR</m>),
          whenever we find a mathematical structure which has the two
          properties of addition and scalar multiplication, we call
          the structure <term>linear</term>. <m>\RR^n</m> is a linear
          space, because vectors allow for addition and scalar
          multiplication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>length</term> of a vector <m>u</m> in <m>\RR^n</m>
          is written <m>|u|</m> and is given by a generalized form of
          the Pythagorean rule for right triangles.
          <me>
            |u| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This length is also called the <term>norm</term> of the
          vector. A vector of length one is called a <term>unit
          vector</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If we think of vectors as directions from the origin towards a
      point, this definition of length gives exactly what we expect:
      the physical length of that arrow in <m>\RR^2</m> and
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Past <m>\RR^3</m>, we don't have a natural notion
      of length. This definition serves as a reasonable
      generalization to <m>\RR^4</m> and higher dimensions which we
      can't visualize. Note also that <m>|u| = 0</m> only if <m>u</m>
      is the zero vector. All other vectors have positive length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the square root is annoying and we find it convenient to
      work with the square of length.
      <me>
        |u|^2 = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The notions of length and difference allow us to define the
      distance between two vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>distance between two vectors</term> <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the length of their difference:
          <m>|u-v|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      You can check from the definition that <m>|u-v| = |v-u|</m>, so
      distance doesn't depend on which comes first. If <m>|\cdot|</m>
      were absolute value in <m>\RR</m>, this definition would match
      the notion of distance between numbers on the number line.
      Difference and length are visualized in <xref
      ref="figure-difference-and-length" />.

      <statement>
        <p>
          We briefly state two properties of vector lenghts without
          proof.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              |u+v| \amp  \leq |u| + |v| \amp  \hspace{1cm} \ \text{
              Triangle Inequality }
            </mrow> 
            <mrow>
              |au| \amp  = |a||u| \amp
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The last line deserves some attention for the notation. When we
      write <m>|a| |u|</m>, <m>|a|</m> is an absolute value of a real
      number and <m>|u|</m> is the length of a vector. The fact that
      they have the same notation is frustrating, but these notations
      are common. (Some text use double bars for the length of a
      vector, <m>||v||</m>, to avoid this particular issue).
