          Let <m>M</m> be a <m>m \times n</m> matrix. The

          Let <m>M</m> be a <m>m \times n</m> matrix. The columnspace
          and the row spaces of <m>M</m> are linear subspaces (of

    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-transformations-of-spans-and-loci" />, we
      defined the image of a matrix or transformation to be the whole
      collection of outputs. (This is what we call the range in single
      variable functions.) There is a nice proposition which tells us
      how to calculate images for linear transformations.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The image of a matrix <m>M</m> is the same as its
          columnspace.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The image is the set of all outputs of <m>M</m>, acting on the
        whole space <m>\RR^n</m>. We can think of <m>\RR^n</m> as the
        span of its standard basis <m>e_1, e_2, \ldots e_n</m>. The
        image, then, is the span of <m>Me_1, Me_2, \ldots Me_n</m>.
        These vectors are precisely the columns of the matrix, so the
        their span is the columnspace.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Look at a <m>3 \times 3</m> vector acting on the standard
          basis of <m>\RR^3</m> to see how the images of the basis
          vectors are the columns of the matrix.

          Let <m>M</m> be a <m>m \times n</m> matrix representing a
          transformation <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>. For any <m>u
          \in \RR^m</m>, the <term>preimage</term> of <m>u</m> is the
          set of all vectors in <m>\RR^m</m> which are mapped to
          <m>u</m> by <m>M</m>. It is writtem <m>M^{-1}\{u\}</m>.
          The <term>kernel</term> or <term>nullspace</term> of
          <m>M</m> is all vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> which are sent to
          the zero vector under the transformation associated to
          <m>M</m>, i.e., the preimage of the origin.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The preimage of <m>u</m> is the solution space of the system
          of equations associated to the extended matrix <m>(M|u)</m>
          where we add the vector <m>u</m> as a column to the matrix
          <m>M</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The preimage is all vectors <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> that are
        sent to <m>u</m>. If we write <m>v</m> in coordinates <m>x_1,
        \ldots, x_n</m>, and apply the matrix action, we get a system
        of <m>m</m> equations with the entries of <m>u</m> as the
        constants. The matrix encoding of this system is precisely
        the extended matrix <m>(M|u)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can look at <m>\RR^2</m> to build our intuition.

            \begin{pmatrix} a \amp b \\ c \amp d \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x_0
            \\ y_0 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we write this out in terms of coordinates, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>
              ax + by \amp  = x_0
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              cx + dy \amp  = y_0
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the system associated to the extended matrix with
          <m>\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \end{pmatrix}</m> as constants.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The connection between kernels, preimages and solutions spaces
      is a deep and important connection between the two pieces of
      this course so far: vector geometry and solving linear system.
      When we started with a linear system, we wrote it as an extended
      matrix. The solution space of that extended matrix
      (<m>(M|u)</m>, where <m>u</m> is the column vector as constants)
      is the same as the vectors <m>v \in \RR^n</m> such that <m>Mv =
      u</m>. Solutions spaces are preimages and preimages are
      solutions spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, the kernel is the linear space of all vector
      <m>v</m> with <m>Mv = 0</m>. This is a solution space for the
      linear system with matrix <m>(M|0)</m>, where the column after
      the dividing line is all zeroes. This gives us a way of
      calcluation kernels and expressing them as spans.
