      <statement>
        <p>
          Compose the functions <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x+4}</m> and <m>g(x)
          = x^2 - 4</m> in both orders. Determine the domain of both
          compositions. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>f \circ g</m>, <m>f</m> is the
          outside function and <m>g</m> is the inside function. We use
          the function <m>g</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>f</m>.
          <me>
            f \circ g(x) = \frac{1}{(x^2-4) + 4} = \frac{1}{x^2} 
          </me>
          In the resulting function, we need to exclude <m>x = 0</m>
          to avoid division by zero. The inside function <m>g</m> has
          no restriction, so there are no other domain concerns and
          the domain is all real numbers except 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>g \circ f</m>, <m>g</m> is the

          <me>
            g \circ f(x) = \left( \frac{1}{x+4} \right)^2 - 4 =
            \frac{1}{(x+4)^2} - 4 
          </me>
          In the resulting function, we need to exclude <m>x = -4</m>
          to avoid division by zero. The inside function <m>f</m> has
          the same restriction, <m>x \neq -4</m>, so there are no
          other domain concerns and the domain is all real numbers
          except <m>-4</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Compose the functions <m>f(x) = e^{x^2-1}</m> and <m>g(x)
          = \sqrt{x^3-5}</m> in both orders. Determine the domain of both
          compositions. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>f \circ g</m>, <m>f</m> is the
          outside function and <m>g</m> is the inside function. We use
          the function <m>g</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>f</m>.
          <me>
            f \circ g(x) = e^{(\sqrt{x^3-5})^2-1} = e^{x^3-5-1} =
            e^{x^3-6}
          </me>
          The resulting function have no obvious domain restrictons.
          However, since we have to do the inside function <m>g</m>
          first, we need to respect the domain restrictions of
          <m>g</m>. The argument in the square root needs to be
          positive, we we need <m>x^3-5 \geq 0</m>. This inequality
          simplifies into <m>x^3 \geq 5</m> and further to <m> x \geq
          \sqrt[3]{5}</m>. Therefore, the domain of the composition is
          all real number <m>x \geq \sqrt[3]{5}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>g \circ f</m>, <m>g</m> is the
          outside function and <m>f</m> is the inside function. We use
          the function <m>f</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>g</m>.
          <me>
            g \circ f(x) = \sqrt{(e^{x^2-1})^3 - 5} =
            \sqrt{e^{3(x^2-1)} - 5}
          </me>
          We've simplified this one step using the laws of exponents.
          Even though this is still a complicated expression, there
          aren't any more reasonable simplification. The domain
          restrictions are also complicated here. The inside function
          <m>f</m> has no restrictions, so we only have to worry about
          the final form; unfortunately, that final form isn't easy to
          pull apart. The square root is the only restrict, so the
          term inside the square root must be non-negative. Let's work
          with that inequality a bit. (We're going to apply a
          logarithm to get ride of the exponential; this respect the
          inequality, since the logarithm is an increasing function.
          Any increasing function preserves inequalities and an
          decreasing function reverses them.)

          After the manipulation of this inequality, we do get an
          understandable domain restriction. This composition is
          define for all real numbers <m>x \geq \sqrt{\frac{1}{3} \ln

        <p>
          Express the function <m>f(x) = \sqrt[4]{x^2-4}</m> as a
          composition of two functions.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We want to write <m>f = g \circ h</m> for some functions
          <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>. We need to break this into successive
          processes. The first observation is that the fourth root
          is the last operations of the function: first we square the
          variable, then subtract 4, then apply the fourth root.
          Therefore, the fourth root is a reasonable choice of the
          outside function, with everything inside the root as the
          inside function. That gives a decomposition.
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sqrt[4]{x} \text{ and
            } h(x) = x^2-4
          </me>
          Note that this isn't the only possible answer. Often there
          are many ways to break apart a function as the composition
          of two (or more) pieces. Here is another possibility.
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sqrt[4]{x-4} \text{ and
            } h(x) = x^2

          We want to write <m>f = g \circ h</m> for some functions
          <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>. We need to break this into successive
          processes. If we want the simplest outside function, we can
          observe that the sine function is the last step, applied to
          everything else in the function. We could choose the sine
          function as the outside function, leaving everything else as
          the inside. 
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sin (x) \text{ and

          </me>
          There are other possible solution. Here is one where we'd
          like the inside function to be slightly simpler. 
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sin (e^x) \text{ and

        <p>
          The function is increasing on this domain (since it is the
          composition of two increasing functions), so it is
          invertible. We follow the steps of the process: set <m>y =
          f(x)</m>, solve for <m>y</m>, then switch variables to write
          the inverse as a function of our conventional independent

        <p>
          When <m>x > 2 </m>, the logarithm <m>\ln (x-1)</m> is positive
          and growing, so its reciprocal is positive and decreasing.
          The function is invertible on this domain.  We follow the

          simply take the reciprocal of each side of the equation;

          operation).

          We plots the points of the data set in the cartesian plane.
          The data here points to a increasing function and looks
          mostly linear. We could simply guess a linear function.
          However, there seems to be a jump between 6 and 7, which
          makes a single line a bit problematic. It could be a more
          complicated kind of function which connects the two pieces.
          It would also be a discontinuous piecewise function:
          sometimes functions make sudden jumps. I've chosen this last
          option, and show two different lines for the two pieces of
          the data set.

          We plots the points of the data set in the cartesian plane.
          The data is increasing, but more and more slowly as we go
          along. We want some kind of function which increases but
          bends downward. Two comnon functions with this behaviours
          are the square root and the logarithm. I've chose to do with
          a square root function.

        <p>
        Consider <m>C(t) = ae^{-bt}</m>, a model of the concentration
        of a chemical over time. Give an interpretation for the
        parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in this model. Assume that
        the parameters are positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        This is the same form as our exponential form for population
        growth, but with a negative exponent. We can use our
        undersatnding of the parameters in population growth to
        interpret these parameters. When <m>t=0</m>, we have <m>C(0) =
        a</m>, so <m>a</m> the starting value. The coefficient in the
        exponential was the rate of exponential growth for population.
        We can likewise conclude that <m>b</m> is control the rate of
        decay of concentration here. We say this is decay because this
        is a negative exponential.

        Consider <m>p(d) = a + bd</m>, a model of the pressure in a
        body of water as a function of depth. Give an interpretation
        for the parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in this model. Assume
        that the parameters are positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        When the depth is zero, we have <m>p(0) = a</m>. We can
        conclude that <m>a</m> is the pressure at the surface of the
        body of water. Since the parameters are positive, this
        pressure increases linearly as the depth increases. The
        parameter <m>b</m> is the slope of this increas, so it measure
        that rate of which we gain pressure as we descend.

        Consider <m>h(t) = a + b\sin(\pi t) - ct</m>, a model of
        hieght of an object as a function of time. Give an
        interpretation for the parameters <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and
        <m>c</m>in this model. Assume that the parameters are
        positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        When the time is 0, we have <m>p(0) = a</m>. Therefore, we can
        call <m>a</m> the starting height. The other pieces of the
        function are sinusoidal oscillation linear decline. The
        parameter <m>b</m> is the amplitude of the sinusoidal piece
        and the parameter <m>c</m> is the negative slope of the linear
        decline. The behaviour of the model comes from adding these
        two behaviours together: so we get some oscillations while
        generally having a linear decline.

        Consider <m>p(t) = (a-b)t + c</m>, a model of population as a
        function of time. Give an interpretation for the parameters
        <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> in this model. Assume that the
        parameters are positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        When time is 0, we have <m>p(0) = c</m>, so <m>c</m> is the
        starting value of the population. The population is linear,
        with slope <m>a-b</m>. This will be positive or negative
        depending on which parameter is larger. Since the parater
        <m>a</m> is positive but we subtract the parameter <m>b</m>,
        <m>a</m> must have a positive effect on the population and
        <m>b</m> must have a negative effect. The simpliest way to
        interpret this is to assume that <m>a</m> is a birth rate and
        <m>b</m> is a death rate. The population will only grow if the
        rate of briths exceeds the rate of deaths.
