          Row reduce this matrix.

            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp -3 \amp 0 \\
              1 \amp 0 \amp 7 \\
              0 \amp -4 \amp -2

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We proceed step-by-step through the row reduction algorithm.
          I'll be very explicit about the row operaion in each step.
          The first row already has a leading one in the first column,
          so we don't need to create one. When we have a leading one,
          we want to clear its colum. We'll start by subtracting row 1
          from row 2. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp -3 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 3 \amp 7 \\
              0 \amp -4 \amp -2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          This has cleared the first column other than the leading 1.
          Now we want a leading one in the second column, if we can.
          To get that, I'll divide the second row by 3. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp -3 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{7}{3}  \\
              0 \amp -4 \amp -2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I have a leading 1, so I want to clear its column. I'll
          add 3 times row 2 to row 1 to clear the entry above the
          leading 1. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 7 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{7}{3}  \\
              0 \amp -4 \amp -2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I'll add 4 times row 2 to row 3 to clear the entry
          below the leading 1.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 7 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{7}{3}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{22}{3}  
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          That clears the second column. Now I want a leading 1 in the
          third column, if I can. I can divide the last row by
          <m>\frac{22}{3}</m> to make a leading 1.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 7 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{7}{3}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1  
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I need to clear the column above this leading 1. I
          subtract 7 times the third row from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{7}{3}  \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1  
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Finally, I subtract <m>\frac{7}{3}</m> times the third row
          from the second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1  
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          This is the row reduced form.

          Row reduce this matrix.

              -1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\
              6 \amp 6 \amp -4 \amp -1

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We proceed step-by-step through the row reduction algorithm.
          I'll be very explicit about the row operaion in each step. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              4 \amp 4 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
              -1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\
              6 \amp 6 \amp -4 \amp -1 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          First I need a leading one in the first column. I could
          divide the first row by 4, but I'd like to avoid introducing
          fractions this early if I can. Instead, I'll mutiply the
          second row by <m>(-1)</m> and then'll interchange
          the first and second row.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp -1 \\
              4 \amp 4 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
              6 \amp 6 \amp -4 \amp -1 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I have a leading one in the first column. I need to
          clear the other entries in this column. I'll subtract 4
          times the first row from the second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp -1 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 8 \amp 5 \\
              6 \amp 6 \amp -4 \amp -1 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I'll subtract 6 times the first row from the third row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp -1 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 8 \amp 5 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 4 \amp 3 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I've clear the first column. Next I'll try to make a
          leading one in the second column. Looking at the matrix,
          though, this is impossible. The only non-zero entry in the
          second column is already behind a leading one -- it can
          never be the first non-zero entry in its rown. Since it is
          impossible to make a leading one in the second column, we
          move on to the third. Here, I'll divide the second row by 8. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp -1 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{8} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 4 \amp 3 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I want to clear the third column above and below the
          leading one. I'll add 2 times the second row to the first
          row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{8} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 4 \amp 3 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I'll subtract 4 times the second row from the third
          row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{8} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{2} 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I want to make a leading one in the last column. I'll
          multiply the last row by 2. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{4} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{8} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the last column above the leading one.
          I'll subtract <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> times the third row from
          the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{8} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Finally, I'll subtract <m>\frac{5}{8}</m> times the third
          row from the second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 
            \end{matrix} \right)

          This is the row reduced form.

        <p>
          I want a leading one in the first row, so I'll divide the
          first row by 2. (There is no avoiding fractions in this row
          reduction.) 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp 0 \\
              -6 \amp 3 \amp 5 \amp 2 \\
              -4 \amp 2 \amp -2 \amp 2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I want to clean the first column under the leading one.
          I add 6 times the first row to the second.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -4 \amp 2 \\
              -4 \amp 2 \amp -2 \amp 2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I add 4 times the first row to the third.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -4 \amp 2 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -8 \amp 2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Now the first column is finished. It is impossible to make a
          leading one in the second column, so we move to the third
          column. I'll divide the second row by <m>(-4)</m>
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp \frac{-3}{2} \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -8 \amp 2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the third column above and below the
          leading one. I add <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> times the second row
          to the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{4} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp -8 \amp 2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I'll add 8 times the second row to the third row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{4} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -2 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          That finishes the third column, so we move of the fourth. We
          can make a leading one in the third row. I divide the third
          row by <m>(-2)</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{4} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{-1}{2} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I want to clear the fourth column. I subtraction
          <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> times the third row from the second row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          Finally, I subtract <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> times the third row
          from the first row. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}

          </me>
          There is already a leading one in the first row, and there
          is already a zero in the second row below it. I need to
          clear the first entry in the third row, so I subtract 7
          times the first row from the third row. 
          <me>

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          There is one non-zero entry in the second column, so we'll
          use that for the leading one. We divide the second row by 3. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          That already finishes the second colulmn. Now we work the
          third column. To make a leading one, I divide the third row
          by 28. (The numbers get a bit unwieldy here, but that often
          happens with row reduction).

          First we write the matrix of the system.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              0 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 0 \\
              -2 \amp -2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\

            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then we row reduce this matrix. After the previous activity
          for row reducing matrices, I'm not going to show all the
          steps; I'll just give the row reduced form calculated by
          computer. You are welcome to do the same for all row
          reductions for the rest of the course. Here is the row
          reduced matrix.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{7}{16} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{-3}{8} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{1}{8} 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Now we need to interpret this in the three ways required by
          the question. The solution as a locus doesn't need any
          interpretation -- the original set of three equations
          defined a locus, since a locus is nothing but the solutions
          of some number of equations in the coordinate variables. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A description by parameters looks for free parameter, which
          are found in columns left of the dividing line without
          leading ones. Then we can interpret the matrix as a new
          system, using these free parameters. Here we have no free
          parameters and there is a unique solution
          <md>
            <mrow>
              x \amp = \frac{7}{16}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              y \amp = \frac{-3}{8}

        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, a description as a span is a rewriting of the
          description by free parameters. For every parameter, we
          think of the coefficients of that parameter as a vector. The
          vector of constants becomes the offset vector. Grouping the
          variables into a vector lets us write the solution as an
          (offset) span. Since this is a unique solution, we only have
          the offset vector and we have no span.

          Finally, a description as a span is a rewriting of the
          description by free parameters. For every parameter, we
          think of the coefficients of that parameter as a vector. The
          vector of constants becomes the offset vector. Grouping the
          variables into a vector lets us write the solution as an
          (offset) span.
          <me>  
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              x \\ y \\ z
            \end{matrix} \right) = 
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 
            \end{matrix} \right) + 
            z \left( \begin{matrix}
              \frac{3}{2} \\ \frac{7}{2} \\ 1 
            \end{matrix} \right) = 
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 
            \end{matrix} \right) + 
            \Span \left\{ \left( \begin{matrix}
              \frac{3}{2} \\ \frac{7}{2} \\ 1
            \end{matrix} \right) \right\} 
          </me>
          If we want, we can scale the span to clear the fraction
          (since a span is all multiple, applying any multiple of the
          vectors in the span has no effect on the span.

          Solve this linear system using a matrix and row reduction.
          Describe the solution as a locus, as a span, and in a
          description by free parameters. In <m>\RR^4</m>, the order
          of variables that we are using in this course is
          <m>w,x,y,z</m>.

          First we write the matrix of the system.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 4 \\
              5 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 2 \\
              0 \amp 6 \amp -3 \amp 0 \amp 1 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Then we row reduce this matrix. After the previous activity
          for row reducing matrices, I'm not going to show all the
          steps; I'll just give the row reduced form calculated by
          computer. You are welcome to do the same for all row
          reductions for the rest of the course. Here is the row
          reduced matrix.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c}
              1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \frac{5}{9} \amp \frac{1}{27} \\
              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{7}{9} \amp \frac{-49}{27} \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{14}{9} \amp \frac{-107}{27} 
            \end{array} \right) 
          </me>
          Now we need to interpret this in the three ways required by
          the question. The solution as a locus doesn't need any
          interpretation -- the original set of three equations
          defined a locus, since a locus is nothing but the solutions
          of some number of equations in the coordinate variables.

          A description by parameters looks for free parameter, which
          are found in columns left of the dividing line without
          leading ones. Then we can interpret the matrix as a new
          system, using these free parameters. Here the fourth column
          has no leading one, so we can use <m>z</m> as the free
          parameter. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              w \amp = \frac{1}{27} - \frac{5}{9} z

              y \amp = \frac{-107}{27} - \frac{14}{9} z

            z \left( \begin{matrix}

          We can scale the term in the span, if we want to clear the
          denominators.
