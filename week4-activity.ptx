          We cannot directly evaluation, since that would lead to
          division by zero. However, we can logically analyze this
          limit. The numerator is fixed and the denominator is getting
          very small. Division by smaller and smaller numbers leads to
          larger and larger numbers. We conclude the limit must be
          infinite. The denominator can be negative or positive, so we
          write 
         <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{1}{x-3} = \pm \infty

          The numerator and denominator both approach zero. This is an
          indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. We need to do
          some manipulations to deal with it. Both terms are
          quadratic, so we will try to factor them to simplify the
          limit.

          Both the numerator and denominator approach zero, so this is

          do anything to the numerator, but we can factor the

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We have a limit involving <m>x</m> and <m>\sin x</m>. We
          want to use the known limit for the ratio of these two
          functions. We manipulate this limit to isolate the known
          limit, using the rules for limits and multiplication.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^2 x}{x} = \lim_{x
            \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}
            \sin x
          </me>
          Then the first part of this is the known limit, which
          evaluates to 1. The second part can be directly evaluated to
          0. The product of 1 and 0 is 0, so the limit is 0.

      <statement>

          Calculate the limit

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This involves trigonometry and <m>x</m>, so we will try to
          isolate the ration of <m>x</m> and <m>\sin x</m>. To do that
          we have to write cotagents in terms of sine and cosine. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x \cot x = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x
            \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
          </me>
          Then we manipulate the limit to isolate the known ratio of
          <m>x</m> amd <m>sin x</m>.
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} \cos x = \lim_{x
            \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}
            \cos x
          </me>
          Now there are two limits, each of which evaluate to 1, so
          the original limit is also 1.

    <title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the vertical asymptotes of the the function
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we look
          for the points on the edge of the domain and take the limits
          approaching those points. Here, domain is all real number
          except <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=1</m>. Those two numbers are the
          roots of the denominator. To determine whether we have
          vertical asymptotes are the undefined points, we need to
          take the limits approaching them. We have two limits to
          consider.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3} \text{ and }
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3} 
          </me>
          Both of these limits are limits where the numerator is fixed
          and the denominator approaches 0. In these cases, dividing by
          very small numbers produced very large numbers, so the
          limits are both <m>\pm \infty</m>. Since the limits are
          infinite, we conclucde that the lines <m>x=1</m> and
          <m>x=3</m> are both vertical asymptotes.

        <p>
          To find vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we look
          for the points on the edge of the domain and take the limits
          approaching those points. Here, domain is all real number
          except <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=-4</m>. Those two numbers are the
          roots of the denominator. To determine whether we have
          vertical asymptotes are the undefined points, we need to
          take the limits approaching them. We have two limits to

            \lim_{x \rightarrow -4} \frac{x-3}{(x-3)(x+4)}
          </me>
          In the first limit, the <m>(x-3)</m> terms cancel out and
          the limit can be directly evaluted to <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>.
          Since this limit if not infinite, this is not a vertical
          asymptote.  In the second limit, the numerator is fixed
          and the denominator approaches 0. In this case, dividing by
          very small numbers produced very large numbers, so the
          limit is <m>\pm \infty</m>. Since the limit is 
          infinite, we conclucde that the line <m>x=-4</m> is
          is a vertical asymptote.

          Unlike the previous questions, this is more about
          familiarity with common functions and shifts in the plane.
          We know that the logarithm has an asymptote at <m>x=0</m>.
          Replacing <m>x</m> by <m>(x-4)</m> is a shift of 4 units in
          the positive direction, so this function has a vertical
          asymptote at <m>x=4</m>.

        <p>
          This is also about fammiliarity with known functions. We
          know the tangent function has asymptotes at every odd
          multiple of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. In this function, we
          multiply by 3 inside the tangent function. The effect of
          this is to move the asymptotes closer together. We now have
          asymptotes at every odd multiple of <m> \frac{\pi}{6}</m>

          To determine continuity, we need to take the limit from the
          left and the limit from the right approaching the cross over
          point. Here are the two limits
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} f(x) \amp = 
              \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-} f(x) \amp = 
              \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-} x^2 + ax + a = a
            </mrow>
          </md>
          We cannot equate these limits, since <m>\infty</m> is not a
          number. There is no value of <m>a</m> which makes this
          piecewise function continuous.

          Consider a population model.

            \end{matrix} \right.

          Is this model continuous? If not, what happens at <m>t =
          20</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We take the limits from the left and from the right to
          determine continuity. The limit from the left is
          <m>\frac{e}{16}</m> from the right is
          <m>\frac{39}{12}e^{\frac{10}{7}}</m>. The approximate values
          of these numbers is, respectively, <m>0.1699</m> and
          <m>13.5614</m>. These are not the same, so the function is
          continuous. At <m>t=10</m> the population has a sudden and
          significant jump; through some process, a large population
          has suddenly been added to the existing population.

          Consider a model of temperature in a chemical reaction, as a
          function of time. 
          <me>
            T(t) = 24 + \frac{\sqrt{(t-5)^3}}{t-5}
          </me>
          The point <m>t=5</m> is the edge of the domain of this
          model. What happens to the temperature as we approach this
          edge point?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We take the limit approaching the edge point.
          <me>
            lim_{t \rightarrow 5} 24 +
            \frac{\sqrt{(t-5)^3}}{t-5} = 24 \lim_{t \rightarrow 5} +
            \frac{(t-5)}{(t-5)} \sqrt{t-5} = 24 + 0 = 24 
          </me>
          Even though the function is undefined, the limit is
          reasonable and the temperature simply approaches 24.
