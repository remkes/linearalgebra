    <title>The Cross Product</title>
    <p>
      The dot product is an operation which can be performed on any
      two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>. There are
      no other conventional products that work in all dimensions.
      However, there is a special product that works in three
      dimensions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> and <m>v = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\
          v_3 \end{pmatrix}</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>. The
          <term>cross product</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          written <m>u \times v</m> and defined by the following
          formula.
          <me>
            u \times v = \begin{pmatrix} u_2v_3 - u_3v_2 \\ u_3v_1 -
            u_1v_3 \\ u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The cross product differs from the dot product in several
      important ways. First, it produces a new vector in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, not a scalar. For this reason, when working in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, the dot product is often refered to as the
      <em>scalar product</em> and the cross product as the <em>vector
      product</em>. Second, the dot product measures, in some sense,
      the similarity of two vectors. The cross product measures, in
      some sense, the difference between two vectors. The cross
      product has greater magnitude if the vectors are closer to being
      perpendicular. If <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>u</m>
      and <m>v</m>, the dot product was expressed in terms of <m>\cos
      \theta</m>. This measures similarity, since <m>\cos 0 = 1</m>.
      There is a similar identity for the cross product:
      <me>
        |u \times v| = |u||v| \sin \theta
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This identity tells us that the cross product measures
      difference in direction, since <m>\sin 0 = 0</m>. In
      particular, this tells us that <m>|u \times u| = 0</m>, implying
      that <m>u \times u = 0</m> (the zero vector is the only vector
      which has zero length). This is another new and strange
      property: in this particular multiplication, everything squares
      to zero. The cross product is obviously very different from
      multiplication of scalars, where <m>a^2 = 0</m> cannot happen
      unless <m>a=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also consider the relationship between <m>u</m> and
      <m>u \times v</m> as calculated through the dot product.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          u \cdot (u \times v) \amp = 
          \begin{pmatrix}
          u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3  
          \end{pmatrix} \cdot
          \begin{pmatrix}
          u_w v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1
          \end{pmatrix}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = u_1u_2v_3 - u_1u_3v_2 + u_2u_3v_1 - u_2u_1v_3 +
          u_3u_1v_2 - u_3u_2v_1 = 0
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar calculation shows that <m>v \cdot (u \times v) =
      0</m>. Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and only
      if the vectors are perpendicular, the vector <m>v \times u</m>
      is perpendicular to both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>. This turns out
      to be a very useful property of the cross product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a calculation from the definition shows that <m>u
      \times v = -(v \times u)</m>. So far, multiplication of scalars
      and the dot product of vectors have not depended on order. The
      cross product is one of many products in mathematics which
      depends on order. If we change the order of the cross product,
      we introduce a negative sign.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Products which do not depend on the order of the factors,
          such as multiplication of scalars and the dot product of
          vectors, are called <term>commutative products</term>.
          Products where changing the order of the factors introduces
          a negative sign are caled <term>anti-commutative
          products</term>. The cross product is an anti-commutative
          product. Other products which have neither of these
          properties are called <term>non-commutative
          products</term>.

    <title>Angular Motion</title>
    <p>
      An important application of the cross product is found in
      describing rotational motion. Linear mechanics describes the
      motion of an object through space but rotational mechanics
      describes the rotation of an object independent of its movement
      through space. A force on an object can cause both kinds of
      movement, obviously. The following table summarizes the
      parallel questions of linear motion and rotational motion in
      <m>\RR^3</m>.

    <p>
      How do we describe torque?  If there is a linear force applied
      to an object which can only rotate around an axis, and if the
      linear force is applied at a distance <m>r</m> from the axis, we
      can think of the force <m>F</m> and the distance <m>r</m> as
      vectors. The torque is then <m>\tau = r \times F</m>. Notice
      that <m>|\tau| = |r||F| \sin \theta</m>, indicating that linear
      force perpendicular to the radius gives the greatest angular
      acceleration. That makes sense. If <m>F</m> and <m>r</m> share
      a direction, then we are pushing directly along the axis and no
      rotation can occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of cross products in rotational dynamics is extended in
      many interesting ways. In fluid dynamics, local rotational
      products of the fluid result in turbulence, vortices and similar
      effects. Tornadoes and hurricanes are particularly extreme
      examples of vortices in the fluid which is our atmosphere. All
      the descriptions of the force and motion of these vortices
      involve cross products in the vectors describing the fluid.

    <title>Local Direction Vectors</title>
    <p>
      We've already spoken about the distinction between elements of
      <m>\RR^n</m> as points and vectors. There is another important
      subtlety that shows up all throughout vector geometry. In
      addition to thinking of vectors as directions starting at the
      origin, we can think of them as directions starting anywhere in
      <m>\RR^n</m>. We call these local direction vectors.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="local-direction-vectors-diagram">
      <caption>Local Direction Vectors</caption>
      <image width="85%" source="images/figure8" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      For example, as pictured in <xref
      ref="local-direction-vectors">Figure</xref>, at the point
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2</m>, we could
      think of the local directions <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m> or <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1
      \end{pmatrix}</m>. These are not directions starting from the
      origin, but starting from <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2
      \end{pmatrix}</m> <em>as if that were the origin</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using vectors to define local directions is a particularly
      useful tool. A standard example is camera location in a three
      dimensional virtual environment. First, you need to know the
      location of the camera, which is an ordinary vector starting
      from the origin. Second, you need to know what direction the
      camera is pointing, which is a local direction vector which
      treats the camera location as the current origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things about learning vector geometry
      is becoming accustomed to local direction vectors. We don't
      always carefully distinguish between vectors at the origin and
      local direction vectors; often, the difference is implied and it
      is up to the reader/student to figure out how the vectors are
      being used.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          The <term>projection</term> of <m>u</m> onto <m>v</m> is a
          scalar multiple of the vector <m>v</m> given by the
          following formula.
          <me>
            \Proj_v u = \left( \frac{u \cdot v}{|v|^2} \right) v
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note that the bracketed term involves the dot product and the
      norm, so it is a scalar. Therefore, the result is a multiple of
      the vector <m>v</m>. Projection is best visualized as the
      shadow of the vector <m>u</m> on the the vector <m>v</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          The part of <m>u</m> which is <term>perpendicular</term> to
          <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
          <me>
            \Perp_v u = u - \Proj_v u
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We can rearrange the previous definition to solve for the
      original vector <m>u</m>.
      <me>
        u = \Proj_v u + \Perp_v u
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For any vector <m>v</m>, every vector <m>u</m> can be decomposed
      into a sum of two unique vectors: one in the direction of
      <m>v</m> and one perpendicular to <m>v</m>. If <m>u</m> and
      <m>v</m> are already perpendicular, then the projection term is
      the zero vector. If <m>u</m> is a multple of <m>v</m>, then the
      perpendicular term is the zero vector. We think of this
      decomposition as capturing two pieces of the vector <m>u</m>:
      the part that aligns with the direction of <m>v</m> and the part
      that has nothing to do with the direction of <m>v</m>. A
      vectors with its projection and perpendicular onto another
      vector is shows in <xref ref="projections">Figure</xref>.
