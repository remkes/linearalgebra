          We need to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalue. We ask
          a computer to do this for us. Since Leslie matrices are
          irreducible matrices with non-negative coefficients, we will
          get a unique largest positive real eigenvalue with a
          positive eigenvector. That is the only eigenvalue we are
          interested in, so it's the only one I'll list here. (The
          other three are either smaller and real, have eigenvectors
          with negative entries, or are complex; none of these are
          useful for determining the population).

          The popluation is not viable, since the dominant eigenvalue
          is less than 1; the population will decay. The age ratios
          will approach <m>1.72:1.65:1.19:1</m> from youngest to
          oldest.

          The population is viable; since the dominant eigenvalue is

          will approach <m>2.15: 1.68:1.49:1</m>. Compared with the
          previous question, two coefficients have been changes: the
          fecundity coefficient of the 3rd age category and the
          survival coefficient from the 2nd to the 3rd age category.
          These were both increase sufficiently to change the non-viable
          population into a viable population.

          This is a viable population; since the dominant eigenvalue
          is positive, this population will grow. That said, since the
          dominant eigenvalue is only slighly above 1, the population
          growth will be relatively slow. As the population grows, the
          age ratios will approach <m>3.21:1.27:1.16:1</m>.

          The population is viable, since the dominant eigenvalue is
          larger than 1. In addition, this is quite a fast growth
          rate, since the eigenvalue is significantly above one. The
          age ratios will approach <m>196.37:3.50:1.87:1</m>. Note
          that these ratios are quite different from previous
          questions: this is a population with many many young
          members, very few of which reach maturity.

          the viable population has now become non-variable. The only
          coefficient that has changed is the survival coefficient
          from the 1st to the 2nd age category. Previously, 3% of the
          youngest survived for a time interval. Now, only 1% survive.
          That change is significant enough to drop the population
          from viable to non-viable.
