          We have a possible maximum net benefit when the marginal cost
          and marginal benefit are equal. We calculate those two and
          set them equal to each other.

          </md>
          Then we look at intervals. Below this critical value, say at
          <m>x=1</m>, the marginal benefit is 2 and the marginal cost
          is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Here the net benefit is increasing,
          since the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost. Above
          the critical value, say at <m>x=4</m>, the marginal cost is
          2 and the marginal benefit is 1. The marginal cost exceeds
          the marginal benefit, so the net benefit is decreasing. We
          conclude that we have a maximum net benefit at approximatly
          <m>x = 2.52</m>2 and the marginal benefit is 1. The marginal
          cost exceeds the marginal benefit, so the net benefit is
          decreasing. We conclude that we have a maximum net benefit

          These cost and benefit functions seems at least somewhat
          reasonable. The benefit function curves down, representing a
          decreasing benefit with growing production. That reasonable
          if the demand for a product eventually dries up. The cost
          function curves up, showing that producing more eventually
          ends up costing a great deal per unit. This might not be
          correct if economies of scale bring down the cost, but it
          might make sense if the skills or materials needed become
          more difficult to acquire.

          Then we look at intervals. The marginal cost is always
          fixed, so we just need to look at the marginal benefit. When
          <m>x \lt 89</m>, say <m>x = 27</m>, the marginal benefit is
          <m>\frac{2}{9}</m>, which is larger than the marginal
          cost. When <m>x \geq 90</m>, say <m>x = 125</m>, then the
          marginal benefit is <m>\frac{2}{25}</m>, which is smaller than
          the marginal cost. Therefore, the net benefit is increasing
          before the critical point and decreasing after it, so we do
          have a maximum.
          </p>

          A computer gives us the two approximate solution. Since the

          This cost function is linear, showing that producing more or

          This solution is not in the range <m>x \leq 2</m>, so there

          <m>\frac{4}{3}</m>, which is always smaller than the
          marginal benefit, so the net benefit is always increasing.

          These can never be equal and the marginal cost is always

          <p>
          Even though we don't have a critical point, we have an

          is increasing and after <m>x=2</m>, the net benefit is

          This cost function curve upwards, meaning that eventually
          the materials or skills needed become scare and it becomes
          more difficult to produce the item or service. The piecewise
          benefit function is more interesting. For the first while,
          benefit is linear, meaning that each unit produces the same
          benefit. However, the benefit suddenly becomes flat, showing
          that after a period of time, the demand is suddenly zero and
          no more benefit can be produces. In this case, the
          break-even analysis isn't very useful, since we are already
          at the highest benefit value much ealier.
