          The popluation is not viable, since the eigenvalue is less

          In the previous question, how much would you need to change

          I mostly need to guess and test. Let me change the

          <me>

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvalue is <m>0.82</m>. This is not
          sufficient. Let me change the coefficient into <m>1.0</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvalue is <m>0.85</m>, which is still
          not sufficient. Let me change the coefficient into
          <m>2.0</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              0 \amp 0 2.0 \amp 0.9 \amp \\

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvalue is <m>0.97</m>. This is still
          not sufficient, but getting better. Let me change the
          coefficient into <m>3.0</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              0 \amp 0 2.0 \amp 0.9 \amp \\

              0 \amp 0 \amp 0.9 \amp 0 \\
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvalue is <m>1.06</m>, so the
          population is now viable. I've overshot here by a bit, but
          this is good enough.

          The popluation is (not) viable

          In the previous question, how much would you have to reduce
          the first survival coefficient to make the population no
          longer viable. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I mostly need to guess and test. I'll first set the survival
          to <m>0.05</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvector is <m>\lambda = 1.49</m> This
          is still not enough. Now I'll set the survival to 
          <m>0.01</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvector is <m>\lambda = 0.83</m>. The
          popuation is no longer viable. I may have overshot a bit, so
          I'll also try <m>0.02</m>.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{matrix}
              0 \amp 15 \amp 200 \amp 100\\
              0.02 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\

            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvector is <m>\lambda = 1.06</m>, so
          perhaps I didn't overshoot that much. I could go to
          coefficients between <m>0.01</m> and <m>0.02</m>, but this
          is sufficient for now.

          The popluation is not viable, since the dominant eigenvalue
          is less than 1.  The age ratios will approach

          In the previous example, how can you change the survival to
          make the population viable. (You may change any of the three
          survival coefficients).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The survival coefficients here are already quite high. The
          maximum they can be is <m>1</m>, since no more than
          <m>100\%</m> of an age category can survive. I'm first going
          to check what happens when I set all the survival
          coefficients equal to <m>1</m>.

              0 \amp 0.32 \amp 0.36 \amp 0.29 \\

              0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
              0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
            \end{matrix} \right) 
          </me>
          The new dominant eigenvalue is <m>0.989</m>. Even with the
          maximum possible survival, the population isn't viable. The
          fecundity rates are simply too low for any hope for this
          population.

          First, I need to write down the stochastic matrix.

            \begin{pmatrix}
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
          Then I calculate (by computer) the dominant eigenvector.

            \begin{pmatrix}
            \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
          This gives me the long-term probability distribution.
          Finally, I calculate a high power of the matrix. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix}

          The entry in the 3rd row and the 2nd column gives the
          propbability of starting in vertex <m>2</m> and ending in
