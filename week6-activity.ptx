      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative by definition.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2-4)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the limit definition of the derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2-4) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{(x+h)^2 - 4 - (x^2-4)}{h} 
          </me>
          Then we simplify this expression, trying to find a way to
          factor an <m>h</m> from the numerator so that we can cancel
          it with the <m>h</m> from the denominator. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+h)^2 - 4 - (x^2-4)}{h}
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2 + 4xh + h^2 - 4 -
              x^2 + 4}{h} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{4xh + h^2}{h} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{h(4x + h)}{h} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} 4x + h  = 4+0 = 4x
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Therefore, the derivative is <m>4x</m>.

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative by definition.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{5x}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the limit definition of the derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{5x} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{\sqrt{5(x+h)} - \sqrt{5h}}{h} 
          </me>
          Then we simplify this expression, trying to find a way to
          factor an <m>h</m> from the numerator so that we can cancel
          it with the <m>h</m> from the denominator. We use a trick
          here called multiplying by the conjugate. This trick will
          remove the square roots from the numerator (it also makes
          the denominator more complicated, but that's not a problem).
          This trick is based on the idea that if we multiply the top
          and bottom of a fraction by the same thing, then we haven't
          changed the value of the fraction at all. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sqrt{5(x+h)} - \sqrt{5}}{h}
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(\sqrt{5(x+h)} -
              \sqrt{5x})(\sqrt{5(x+h)} + \sqrt{5x}}{h(\sqrt{5(x+h)} -
              \sqrt{5x})}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{5(x+h) -
              5x}{h(\sqrt{5(x+h)} + \sqrt{5x})} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{5x + 5h -
              5x}{h(\sqrt{5(x+h)} + \sqrt{5x})} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{5h}{h(\sqrt{5(x+h)}
              + \sqrt{5x})} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{5}{(\sqrt{5(x+h)}
              + \sqrt{5x})} 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          After multiplying by the conjugate, simplifying the
          numerator, and cancelling the <m>h</m> from numerator and
          denominator, we reach a point where we can simply evaluate
          the limit by replacing <m>h</m> with 0. 
          <me>
           \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{5}{(\sqrt{5(x+h)}
            + \sqrt{5x})} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{5x}+ \sqrt{5x}} =
            \frac{5}{2\sqrt{5x}} 
          </me>
          This is a reasonable expression for the derivative of the
          original function.

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} 8x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can use linearity to split this up into four derivatives. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} 8x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1 = \frac{d}{dx} 8x^3 -
            \frac{d}{dx} 4x^2 + \frac{d}{dx} 3x + \frac{d}{dx} 1 
          </me>
          We can use linearity again to take out the constant. 
          <me>
            = 8 \frac{d}{dx} x^3 - 4 \frac{d}{dx} x^2 + 3 \frac{d}{dx}
            x + \frac{d}{dx} 1 
          </me>
          Then we apply the product rule to the first two derivatives,
          and known deriavtive for the second pair. 
          <me>
            = 8 (3x^2) - 4 (2x) + 3 (1) + 0 = 24x^2 - 8x + 3
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} 9x^4 - 2x^3 - x - 17
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can use linearity to split this up and pull out the
          constant. (In the previous question, I did this over two
          linearity steps. As we move on, we tend to show fewer steps
          and apply the rules more quickly and less explicitly.) 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} 9x^4 - 2x^3 - x - 17 = 9 \frac{d}{dx} x^4 - 2
            \frac{d}{dx} x^3 - \frac{d}{dx} x - \frac{d}{dx} 17
          </me>
          Then we use the power rule and known derivatives. 
          <me>
            = 9 (4x^3) - 2 (3x^2) - 1 - 0 = 36x^3 - 6x^2 - 1
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2) \sin x
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the product rule. I will label the pieces as <m>f(x)
          = x^2</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin x</m>. Here is the form of the
          product rule.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) = f(x) \frac{d}{dx} g(x) + g(x)
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) 
          </me>
          We apply this form to the piece of this product. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2) \sin x = x^2 \frac{d}{dx} (\sin x) +
            (\sin x) \frac{d}{dx} x^2 
          </me>
          We apply the power rule for the polynomial derivative and
          the known derivative of the sine function from our tables. 
          <me>
            = x^2 (\cos x) + (\sin x) (2x)
          </me>
          This is a reasonable way to leave the answer. However, by
          pure convention, I like to write polynoials before trig
          function, so I'll write the answer slightly differently. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2) \sin x = x^2\cos x + 2x\sin x
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2+3)(x^3 - 7x - 1)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the product rule. I will label the pieces as <m>f(x)
          = (x^2 + 3) </m> and <m>g(x) = (x^3 - 7x - 1)</m>. Here is
          the form of the product rule.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) = f(x) \frac{d}{dx} g(x) + g(x)
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) 
          </me>
          We apply this form to the piece of this product. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2+3)(x^3 - 7x - 1) = (x^2 + 3)
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^3 - 7x - 1) + (x^3 - 7x - 1) \frac{d}{dx}
            (x^2+3)
          </me>
          Then, in each of the two derivatives, we use linearity to
          split the derivative up over the pieces. 
          <me>
            = (x^2+3) \left( \frac{d}{dx} x^3 - 7 \frac{d}{dx} x -
            \frac{d}{dx} 1 \right) + (x^3 - 7x - 1) \left( \frac{d}{dx}
            x^2 + \frac{d}{dx} 3 \right)
          </me>
          Then we use the power rule and known derivatives to evaluate
          all the individual derivatives. 
          <me>
            = (x^2+3) \left( 3x^2  - 7 - 0 \right) + (x^3 - 7x - 1)
            \left( 2x + 0 \right)
          </me>
          We could leave it in this form -- this is a valid answer.
          However, expanding and simplifying into a single polynomial
          is certainly a cleaner way to leave the answer. 
          <me>
            = 3x^4 + 9x^2 - 7x^2 - 21  + 2x^4 - 14x^2 - 2x = 5x^4 -
            12x^2 - 2x - 21
          </me>

      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^2+3}{x-4}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the quotient rule. I will label the pieces as <m>f(x)
          = x^2+3</m> and <m>g(x) = x-4</m>. Here is the form of the
          product rule.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) = g(x) \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - f(x)
            \frac{d}{dx} g(x) 
          </me>
          We apply this form to the piece of this product. 
          <me>
            \frac{(x-4) \frac{d}{dx} (x^2+3) - (x^2+3) \frac{d}{dx}
            (x-4)}{(x-4))^2}
          </me>
          We use linearity to split up the derivatives in the
          numerator. Then we use the power rule and known derivatives
          for these derivatives. 
          <me>
            \frac{(x-4) \left( 2x + 0 \right) - (x^2+3)
            (1-0)}{(x-4))^2}
          </me>
          To put the answer in a more pleasant form, we distribute the
          multiplications in the numerator to write it as one
          polynomial. 
          <me>
            \frac{2x^2 - 8x - x^2 - 3}{(x-4))^2} = \frac{x^2 - 8x -
            3}{(x-4)^2} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{x} + x^2
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use linearity to split up the derivative. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{x} + x^2 = \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{x} +
            \frac{d}{dx} x^2 
          </me>
          The second derivative is a power rule, which we are pretty
          familiar with by this point. The first is also a power rule,
          if we write the square root as a fractional exponent:
          <m>\sqrt{x} = x^\frac{1}{2}</m>. 
          <me>
            = \frac{d}{dx} x^{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{d}{dx} x^2 =
            \frac{1}{2} x^{-\frac{1}{2}} + 2x 
          </me>
          To finish, I'll return the fractional exponent to a square
          root form, since that is the more conventional notation.
          <me>
            = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} + 2x

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the product rule. I will label the pieces as <m>f(x)
          = e^x</m> and <m>g(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>. Here is the form of the
          product rule.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) = f(x) \frac{d}{dx} g(x) + g(x)
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) 
          </me>
          We apply this form to the piece of this product. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} e^x \sqrt{x} = e^x \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{x} +
            \sqrt{x} \frac{d}{dx} e^x
          </me>
          The derivative of the exponential function is itself, but we
          have to write the square root as a fracitonal exponent to
          use the power rule to differentiate it. 
          <me>
            = e^x \frac{d}{dx} x^\frac{1}{2} +
            \sqrt{x} \frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x \frac{1}{2}
            x^{\frac{-1}{2}} + \sqrt{x} e^x 
          </me>
          I'll change the fractional exponent back to a conventional
          square root expression. I'll also factor out the exponential
          term which is common to both expressions. 
          <me>
            = e^x \left( \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} + \sqrt{x} \right)

          product rule.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) = g(x) \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - f(x)
            \frac{d}{dx} g(x)

          We apply this form to the piece of this product. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^2+4} = \frac{ (x^2+4)

            (x^2+4)}{(x^2+4)^2} 
          </me>
          We need to evaluate both the derivative in the numerator.
          The second can be evaluated with linearity and the power
          rule, like all polynomials. The first is evaluated by
          writing the square root as a fractional exponent.

          This is an answers, but as usual, I'll make some
          simplifications to give a more pleasant and usable form of
          the answer.

          We use the quotient rule. I will label the pieces as <m>f(x)
          = e^x</m> and <m>g(x) = x^2+1</m>. Here is the form of the
          product rule.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) = g(x) \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - f(x)
            \frac{d}{dx} g(x) 
          </me>
          We apply this form to the piece of this product. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \frac{e^x}{x^2+1} = \frac{ (x^2+1)
            \frac{d}{dx} e^x - e^x \frac{d}{dx} (x^2+1)}{(x^2+1)^2}
          </me>
          The first derivative is the known derivative of the
          exponential function. The second deriative, like all
          polynomial, is solved by linearity and the power rule. 
          <me>
            = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{e^x}{x^2+1} = \frac{ (x^2+1)
            e^x - e^x (2x+0)}{(x^2+1)^2}
          </me>
          As usual, I'll make some simplifications to the result of
          the derivative. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \frac{e^x}{x^2+1} = \frac{ e^x (-x^2+1)}
            {(x^2+1)^2}

          These are both quotient rule derivatives. I'll not write the
          general form and labelling here, but proceed with the
          specific calculation.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\cos x}{x} + \frac{\sin x}{x} =
            \frac{x \frac{d}{dx} \cos x - \cos x \frac{d}{dx}
            x}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{x \frac{d}{dx} \sin x - \sin x
            \frac{d}{dx} x}{\sin^2 x} 
          </me>
          Then we need to all four of the specific derivatives, which
          are all known derivatives. 
          <me>
            = \frac{-x \sin x - \cos x}{\cos^2} + \frac{x \cos x -
            \sin x}{\sin^2 x}
          </me>
          Some change in expression could be made -- common
          denominator for both fractions, or splitting up numerators.
          None of them seems to me to create any substantially simpler
          expression, so I'm content to leave the answer in this form.

          This is a triple product. We still need the product rule,
          but we have to be conscious of the group. There are several
          options, but I will choose <m>f(x) = (x^2+1)</m> and <m>g(x)
          = (\sin x)(e^x)</m>. Then I proceed with the product rule
          form. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} (x^2+1)(\sin x)(e^x) = (x^2+1) \frac{d}{dx}
            \left( (\sin x)(e^x) \right) + (\sin x)(e^x) \frac{d}{dx}
            (x^2+1)
          </me>
          The second derivative is a reasonable polynomial, solved by
          linearity. The first derivative, however, is still a
          product. We need to do another product rule with this
          product. 
          <me>
            = (x^2+1) \left( e^x \frac{d}{dx} \sin x + \sin x
            \frac{d}{dx} e^x \right) + (\sin x)(e^x) (2x+0)
          </me>
          Then I just need to use the two known derivatives of the
          sine function and the exponential function.
          <me>
            = (x^2+1) \left( e^x \cos x + \sin x e^x \right) 
            + (\sin x)(e^x) (2x)
          </me>
          I can simplify this slightly by factoring out the
          exponential and combining the polynomial terms.
