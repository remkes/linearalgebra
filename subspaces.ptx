      In addition to vectors, we want to consider various geometric
      objects that live in <m>\RR^n</m>. Since this is linear
      algebra, we will be restricting ourselves to flat objects.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>linear subspace</term> of <m>\RR^n</m> is a
          non-empty set of vectors <m>L</m> which satisfies the
          following two properties.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>u,v \in L</m> then <m>u+v \in L</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>u \in L</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m> then <m>av \in
                L</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      There are two basic operations on <m>\RR^n</m>: we can add
      vectors and we can multiply by scalars. Linear subspaces are
      just subsets where we can still perform both operations and
      remain in the subset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geometrically, vector addition and scalar multiplication produce
      flat objects: lines, planes, and their higher-dimensions
      analogues. Also, since we can take <m>a=0</m>, we must have
      <m>0 \in L</m>. So linear subspaces can be informally defined
      as flat subsets which include the origin.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>affine subspace</term> of <m>\RR^n</m> is a
          non-empty set of vectors <m>A</m> which can be described as
          a sum <m>v+u</m> where <m>v</m> is a fixed vector and
          <m>u</m> is any vector in some fixed linear subspace
          <m>L</m>. With some abuse of notation, we write this as a
          sum of a fixed vector and a linear subspace.
          <me>
            A = v + L
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We think of affine subspaces as flat spaces that may be
          offset from the origin. The vector <m>v</m> is called the
          <term>offset vector</term>. Affine spaces include linear
          spaces, since we can also take <m>u</m> to be the zero
          vector and have <m>A=L</m>. Affine objects are the lines,
          planes and higher dimensional flat objects that may or may
          not pass through the origin.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Notice that we defined both affine and linear subspaces to be
      non-empty. The empty set <m>\emptyset</m> is <em>not</em> a
      linear or affine subspace. The smallest linear subspace if
      <m>\{0\}</m>: just the origin. The smallest affine subspace is
      any isolated point.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need ways to algebraically describe linear and affine
      substapces. There are two main approaches: loci and spans.

    <title>Loci</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider any set of linear equations in the variables
          <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>. The <term>locus</term> in
          <m>\RR^n</m> of this set of equations is the set of vectors
          which satisfy <term>all</term> of the equations. The plural
          of locus is <term>loci</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In general, the equations can be of any sort. The unit circle
      in <m>\RR^2</m> is most commonly defined as the locus of the
      equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. The graph of a function is the
      locus of the equation <m>y = f(x)</m>. However, in linear
      algebra, we exclude curved objects. We're concerned with
      linear/affine objects: things which are straight and flat.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_i</m> and <m>c</m> be real numbers. A <term>linear
          equation</term> in variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n</m> is
          an equation of the following form.
          <me>
            a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any linear or affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> can be
          described as the locus of finitely many linear equations.
          Likewise, the locus of any number of linear equations is
          either an affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> or the empty set.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The best way to think about loci is in terms of restrictions.
      We start with all of <m>\RR^n</m> as the locus of no equations,
      or of the equation <m>0=0</m>. There are no restrictions. Then
      we introduce equations. Each equation is a restriction on the
      available points. If we work in <m>\RR^2</m>, adding the
      equation <m>x=3</m> restricts us to a vertical line passing
      through the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix}</m> . Likewise, if we were to use the equation
      <m>y=4</m>, we would have a horizontal line passing through the
      <m>y</m>-axis at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
      If we consider the locus of <em>both</em> equations, we have
      only one point remaining: <m>\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4
      \end{pmatrix}</m> is the only point that satisfies both
      equations. In this way, each additional equation potentially
      adds an additional restrictions and leads to a smaller linear or
      affine subspaces. The next three definitions give the familiar
      names for loci of one restriction.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>line</term> in <m>\RR^2</m> is the locus of the
          equation <m>ax + by = c</m> for <m>a,b,c \in \RR</m>. In
          general, the line is affine. The line is linear if
          <m>c=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>plane</term> in <m>\RR^3</m> is the locus of the
          linear equation <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>. In general, the
          plane is affine. The plane is linear if <m>d=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If we think of a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> as the locus of one
      linear equation, the important dimensional fact about a plane is
      not that it has dimension two but that it has dimension one less
      than its ambient space <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>hyperplane</term> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the locus of
          one linear equation: <m>a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n
          = c</m>. It has dimension <m>n-1</m>. It is, in general,
          affine. The hyperplane is linear if <m>c=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      All this discussion is pointing towards the notion of dimension.
      The dimension of <m>\RR^n</m> is <m>n</m>; it is the number of
      independent directions or degrees of freedom of movement. For
      linear or affice subspaces, we also want a well-defined notion
      of dimension. So far it looks good: the restriction of a linear
      equation should drop the dimension by one. A line in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, which is one dimensional in a three dimensional
      space, should be the locus of two different linear equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like the dimension of a locus to be simply determined
      by the dimension of the ambient space minus the number of
      equations. However, there is a problem with the na√Øve
      approach to dimension. In <m>\RR^2</m>, adding two linear
      equations should drop the dimension by two, giving a dimension
      zero subspace: a point. However, consider the equations <m>3x +
      4y = 0</m> and <m>6x + 8y = 0</m>. We have two equations, but
      the second is redundant. All points on the line <m>3x + 4y =
      0</m> are already satisfied by the second equation. So, the
      locus of the two equations only drops the dimension by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^3</m> the equations <m>y=0</m>, <m>z=0</m> and
      <m>y+z=0</m> have a locus which is the <m>x</m> axis. This is
      one dimensional in a three dimensional space, so the dimension
      from the three equations has only dropped by two. One of the
      equations is redundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem scales into higher dimensions. In <m>\RR^n</m>, if
      we have several equations, it is almost impossible to see, at a
      glance, whether any of the equations are redundant. We need
      methods to calculate dimension. Unfortunately, those methods
      will have to wait until later in these notes.

  <subsection xml:id="intersection">
    <title>Intersection</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, their intersection <m>A
          \cap B</m> is the set of all points they have in common.
          The intersection of affine subspaces is also an affine
          subspace. If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both linear, the
          intersection is also linear.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Loci can easily be understood as intersections. Consider
          the locus of two equations, say the example we have from
          <m>\RR^2</m> before: the locus of <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m>.
          We defined this directly as a single locus. However, we
          could just as easily think of this as the intersection of
          the two lines given by <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m> seperately.
          In this way, it is the intersection of two loci. Similarly,
          all loci are the intersection of the planes or hyperplanes
          defined by each individual linear equation.
