    The determinant of a (square) matrix is constructed recursively,
    starting with <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices.
    <me>
      \det \left( \begin{matrix} a \amp  b \\ c \amp  d \end{matrix} \right) = \left| \begin{matrix} a \amp  b \\ c \amp  d \end{matrix} \right| = ad-bc
    </me>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For the matrix <m>\left( \begin{matrix}1 \amp -3 \\ 2 \amp -1 \end{matrix} \right)</m>,
        the determinant is <m>(1)(-1) - (2)(-3) = -1 + 6 = 5</m>.
        Therefore, we know that this matrix multiplies all areas by a factor of <m>5</m> and preserves orientation.

        The algorithm for calculating determinants in general is call
        <term>Co-Factor Expansion</term>.
        It is a recursive algorithm that reduces determinant calculation to determinants of smaller square matrices,
        eventually down to <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices.

    Co-factor expansion procceds in this way:
    we choose <em>any</em> column or row of the matrix.
    We take the coefficients from that column or row.
    For each of the coefficients,
    we multiply that coefficient by the detminant of the matrix formed by removing both the columnn and row containig that coefficient.
    Then we add up the determinants of these small matrices multiplied by matching coefficients,
    with a pattern of <m>\pm</m> signs.
    That pattern of <m>\pm</m> signs is a checkerboard pattern,
    as in the following <m>5 \times 5</m> matrix.
    <me>
      \left( \begin{matrix} + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  + \\ - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \\ + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  + \\ - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \\ + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  + \end{matrix} \right)

    That's a hard algorithm to intuit from the formal description.
    Let's do a number of examples.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Here is a <m>3 \times 3</m> example where we choose the first row for cofactor expansion.
        <md>
          <mrow>\left| \begin{matrix} 5 \amp  -2 \amp  0</mrow>
          <mrow>-3 \amp  3 \amp  -2</mrow>
          <mrow>1 \amp  -5 \amp  3 \end{matrix} \right| \amp  = (+1) 5 \left| \begin{matrix} 3 \amp  -2</mrow>
          <mrow>-5 \amp  3 \end{matrix} \right| + (-1) (-2) \left| \begin{matrix} -3 \amp  -2</mrow>
          <mrow>1 \amp  3 \end{matrix} \right| + (+1) (0) \left| \begin{matrix} -3 \amp  3</mrow>
          <mrow>1 \amp  -5 \end{matrix} \right|</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 5 ((3)(3) - (-2)(-5)) + 2( (-3)(3) - (-2)(1)) + (0) (-3)(-5) - (3)(1)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 5 (-1) + 2 (-7) = - 19</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

    If we did cofactor expansion of an arbitrary <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix,
    we would get a direct expression for the determinant.
    <me>
      \left| \begin{matrix} a \amp  b \amp  c \\ d \amp  e \amp  f \\ g \amp  h \amp  i \end{matrix} \right| = aei - ahf - bdi + bfg + cdh - ceg
    </me>

    We could use this formula for
    <m>3 \times 3</m> matrices, if we wished.
    We could do the same for larger matrices,
    but it starts to get quite complicated.
    The computational complexity of the recursive determinant algorithm grows very quickly.
    For a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix,
    we had 3 recursions to <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices,
    each with <m>2</m> multiplication terms in the determinant,
    giving <m>6</m> terms.
    Each term was the multiple of three coefficients,
    giving <m>12</m> total multiplications.
    For a <m>4 \times 4</m>, the recursions gives <m>24</m> terms,
    each with <m>4</m> coefficients,
    so <m>24\cdot 3 = 72</m> multiplications.
    For a <m>5 \times 5</m> matrix,
    we recurse five times to a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix,
    for <m>120</m> terms each with <m>5</m> coefficients,
    which is <m>120 \cdot 4 = 600</m> multiplications.
    The pattern continues:
    there are <m>n!</m> terms in the determinant of a <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    each with <m>n</m> coefficient,
    for <m>n! (n-1)</m> multiplications.
    This is computationally terrifying,
    making determinants of large matrices computationally very difficult.
