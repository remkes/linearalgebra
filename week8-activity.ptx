          We need a pattern. This is an arithmetic sequence, where we

          we can start at <m>i=0</m> and describe this pattern as <m>1
          + 3i</m>. The value of <m>i</m> that gives 19 is <m>i=6</m>,

          We need a pattern. This is a geometric progression, where we

          this, we can start at <m>i=0</m> and describe this pattern
          as <m>3(2^i)</m>. The value of <m>i</m> that gives 96 is
          <m>i = 5</m>, so our sum will end at 6.

          We need a pattern. We have a couple options. We could keep
          this in ths order is it written in, start from 16, and
          subtract 2 in each step. We could also change the order and
          write this as an arithmetic progression startnig at 4. I'll
          chose the first option, starting with <m>i=0</m> and writing
          <m>16 -2i</m> for the pattern. When <m>i=6</m>, we get the
          last term, so our sum will end at 6.

          by definition using the Reimann definition of the integral.
          First, write the definition of the integral and replace the

      <solution>
        <p>
          There is a general form for <m>x_k^*</m> in notes.
          <me>
            x_k^* = a + k \frac{b-a}{n}

          Now we put in the values for this particular integral.

            x_k^* = -1 + k \frac{1-(-1)}{n}  = -1 + \frac{2k}{n}

          Then we can return to the form from the previous section and

          We have two pieces of the sum from the end of the previous
          part. We split this into two sums and pull out the
          constants. Note that <m>k</m> is the index of the sum, so
          anything that doesn't involve <m>k</m> is a constant. That
          means that <m>n</m> is a constant as far as the sum is
          concerned and can be brought outside.

          The constant term 2 remains unchanged in the limit. Other
          term is a fraction with <m>n^3</m> in the numerator and
          denominator. Since these have the same asymptotic order,
          asymptotic analysis tells that the limit is the ratio of the
          leading coefficient.

          For the first integral, we have to do the power rule

          function is its own derivative, it is also its own
