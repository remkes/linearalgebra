    <title>Properties of Vector Arithmetic</title>
    <p>
      In the themes of the course, I said that algebra was the study
      of structures on sets. I'll talk in more detail about this them
      in <xref ref="section-sets-with-structure" />, but we've already
      seen our first important example.  In <xref
      ref="section-vector-arithmetic" />, we introduced three
      structures on <m>\RR^n</m>: vector addition, scalar
      multiplication, and vector length. The abstract algebraic
      question that mathematicians ask at this point is: what are the
      properties of these structures? How does vector addition
      resemble normal addition (which is it named after) and how does
      it differ? How does scalar multiplication resemble normal
      multiplication (which is it named after) and how does it differ?
      How does length differ from absolute value (which shares the
      same notation?
    </p>
    <p>
      These are abstract questions, but they are also practically
      useful. If we are in a situation where we need to use linear
      algebra (of which there are many), we need to know how to
      manipulate the objects. We have a whole collection of a habits
      with addition and multiplication, but we can't assume that all
      those habits immediately transfer to these new structures. If
      the new structures resemlee the old, we have to prove it to be
      sure. If they don't, we have to adjust our habits. We'll see
      both cases happen in this course. In this section, we'll mostly
      be proving that the properties of ordinary addition and
      multiplication carry over to these new structures.  Later in the
      course, we'll have new structures which have properties that are
      different from what we expect for conventional arithmetic.

    <p>
      In the notes, I'm going to address three properties of scalar
      multiplication and vector addition. Some properties of the
      vector length operation are left for the activities.

  <subsection xml-id="subsection-commutativity">
    <title>Commutativity</title>
    <p>
      Addition and multiplication of numbers are commutative binary
      operations. This means that we can interchange the order: <m>4 +
      5</m> is the same as <m>5 + 4</m> and <m>7 \times 2</m> is the
      same as <m>2 \times 7</m>. We've defined a new addition and a
      new multiplication, but we can't just assume that these new
      structures are commutative. We have to prove it. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Vector addition is commutative. That is, for any two vector
          <m>u, v \in \RR^n</m>,
          <me>
            u + v = v + u 
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          When approaching a proof, it is often very useful to return
          to the definition. Let me first work in <m>\RR^2</m> to
          illustrate; I'll generalize to <m>\RR^n</m> afterwards. We
          have two vectors <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m>. I write them as
          components.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp u = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{pmatrix} 
              \amp \amp v = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I use the definition of vector addition. I'll start
          with the left side of the equation and try to work towards
          the right. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u + v \amp = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{pmatrix} 
              + \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2 
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          That's the definition. Now each addition in the components
          (<m>u_1 + v_1</m> and <m>u_2 + v_2</m>) is the addition of
          ordinary numbers, so we can reverse the order of this
          addition. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 + u_1 \\ v_2 + u_2 
              \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          The result is precisely the definition of the right side. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp = v + u
            </mrow>
          </md>
          We started on the left side of the desired equation and
          ended up the with the right side, thus proving the identity.
          This was for <m>\RR^2</m>, so I still need to do the general
          case for <m>\RR^n</m>. Luckily for me, the steps are exactly
          the same, just for a vector with <m>n</m>
          components. Here are the steps in the general case: first I
          use the definition of <m>u + v</m>, then I switch the order
          of the ordinary addition of numbers in each component, then
          I use the definition of <m>v + u</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u + v \amp = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
              \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\
              v_n \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_2  \\ u_2 + v_2 \\ 
              \vdots \\ u_n + v_n \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 + u_2  \\ v_2 + u_2 \\ 
              \vdots \\ v_n + u_n \end{pmatrix} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = v + u
            </mrow>
          </md>
          That is the proof for the general case, so we are done.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      I want to point out a couple of things about this proof. First,
      it is general. I didn't try to prove by choosing specific
      vectors and checking. We can't prove by examples. That said, often
      working through some examples is extremely valuable. When
      starting a proof, I'll often try some examples to get a sense of
      what is going on. But, in the end, the argument needs to be
      general <mdash /> it must cover all possible cases in the
      statement of the proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, I never started with <m>u + v = v + u</m>. I started
      with the left side and worked my way to the right (though I
      could have just as easily started from the right and worked my
      way to the left). I should never assume what I want to prove, so
      I should never write <m>u + v = v + u</m> until the end of the
      proof, when it has been established. If I'm trying to
      figure out how to do a proof, I'll often work backwards: I'll
      start with the statement I want to get to, manipulate it and see
      how the piece work. But when I write up the proof, I'm never
      starting with my goal, only finishing with it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This proof establishes commutativity of vector addition. What
      about scalar multiplication? For real numbers, we know <m>ab =
      ba</m>. However, scalar multiplication is something quite
      different. If <m>a</m> is a scalar and <m>u</m> is a vector,
      then <m>au</m> produces another vector. In defining scalar
      multiplication, we wrote the scalar on the left and the vector
      on the right. Right now, the expression <m>ua</m> doesn't even
      mean anything. We could define it to mean the same thing, so
      that we could do scalar multiplication on either side, but our
      convention is to always write the scalar on the left and the
      vector on the right.  In this way, scalar multiplication isn't
      commutative because of our choice of notation. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml-id="subsection-vector-arithmetic-associativity">
    <title>Associativity</title>
    <p>
      Another property of ordinary addition and multiplication is
      associativity. This property states that we can bracket a
      three-fold addition or multiplication either way and the result
      is the same. For addition, this is
      <me>
        a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c 
      </me>.
      For multiplication, this is similarly
      <me>
        a(bc) = (ab)c
      </me>.
      To be more explicit, consider the sum <m>6 + 4 + 9</m>. We can
      add this in two ways. If we start with the left sum, we get
      <m>10 + 9 = 19</m>. If we start with the right sum, we get <m>6
      + 13 = 19</m>. Both ways produce <m>19</m>; associativity says
      that this works for all sums of numbers. Associativity is a
      property which we very rarely think about. It is naturally built
      into our number sense and, when doing arithmetic, we use it
      implicitly and subconsciously all the time. However, it is a
      property we have to worry about for new operations. There are
      (strangely enough!) non-associative operations in mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, both vector addition and scalar multiplication are
      associative. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u,v,w \in \RR^n</m> are vectors, then 
          <me>
            (u + v) + w = u + (v + w) 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The proof is nearly identify to the proof of commutativity. We
      write the vectors with components and then use the associativity
      of ordinary addition in each component. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For scalar multiplication, since there are vectors and scalars
      involved, we have to be careful how we even state associativity. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u\in \RR^n</m> and <m>a,b, \in \RR</m>  then 
          <me>
            a(bu) = (ab)u
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This is the only statement of associativity that makes sense. We
      can't multiply vectors, but we can do successive
      multiplication by different scalars. The property here says that
      we can do two scalar multiplications with the vector u, or we
      can first multiple the scalars normally then do one scalar
      mulitplication. The proof is also like the proof for
      commutativity: we write everything in components and use the
      associativity of ordinary multiplication. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml-id="subsection-vector-arithmetic-distribution">
    <title>Distribution</title>
      <p>
        For real numbers, multiplication distributes over addition. 
        <me>
          a(b + c) = ab + ac 
        </me>
        For vector addition and scalar multiplication, distribution
        still works. There are two versions of the distributive law
        here. 
      </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u,\in \RR^n</m> and <m>a,b \in \RR</m>, then 
          <me>
            (a + b)u = au + bu 
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u,v \in \RR^n</m>  and <m>a \in \RR</m>, then
          <me>
            a(u + v) = au + av 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In the first version, the addition is happening with the
      scalars. In the second, the addition is happening with the
      vectors. Since these are different kinds of addition, two
      different statements are required. The proofs are again like the
      commutativity proofs: write everything in components and use the
      distributive rules for ordinary numbers in each component.
