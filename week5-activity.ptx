          is <m>x^2</m>. Since 2 is less than <m>\frac{5}{2}</m>, the
          numerator has a higher asymptotic order. Since the leading
          coefficients are positive and the square root produces a
          positive number, this limit diverges to <m>\infty</m>.

          by ignoring the 1, giving <m>\sqrt[3]{x^5} =

          <m>e^{2x}</m>. By the laws of exponents, <m>e^{2x} = (e^x)^2
          = e^x e^x </m>. If we compare the two asymptotic orders and
          remove <m>e^x</m> form each, what is left in the numerator
          is <m>x^2</m> amd what is left in the denominator is
          <m>e^x</m>. In this way, we see that the denominator has

          base e, of course) that a higher exponential coefficient
          means a higher asymptotic order. Therefore, the denominator
          has higher asymptotic order and the limit converges to 0.

          The denominator has higher asymptotic order: <m>x^2 >
          x</m>. Therefore, the limit approaching <m>\infty</m> is 0,
          meaning that <m>y=0</m> is a horizontal asymptote in the
          positive direction. In the negative direction, the result is

        <p>
          As <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>, since the asymptotic orders

          the ration of the leading terms, which is
          <m>\frac{8}{17}</m>. Therefore, <m>y=\frac{8}{17}</m> is a
          horizontal asymptote in the positive direction. In the
          negative direction, the behaviour is the same. Both of the
          <m>x^3</m> terms will be negative, but the negatives will
          cancel and the limits will still be <m>\frac{8}{17}</m>,
          making <m>y=\frac{8}{17}</m> a horizontal asymptote in both

        <p>
          The asymptotic order of both numerator and denominator is
          <m>\ln x</m>. Since they are the same, the limit as <m>x
          \rightarrow \infty</m> is the limit of the leading
          coefficients: <m>\frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}</m>. Therefore,
          <m>y=\frac{2}{3}</m> is a horizontal asymptote in the
          positive direction. There cannot e any horizontal asymptote
          in the negative direction, since the domain of the function

        <p>
          As <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>, the denominator of the
          fraction <m>\frac{4}{3-x}</m> approaches <m>-\infty</m>.
          Since the numerator is fixed, the fraction itself approach
          0. That leaves the limit as <m>\frac{1}{6-0} =
          \frac{1}{6}</m>. Therefore, <m>y = \frac{1}{6}</m> is a
          horizontal asymptote int he positive direction. The same
          logic works for <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>; the only
          difference is that the denominator of the fraction is
          positive, but the conclusions are the same. Therefore, <m>y

          Unlike the previous question, this is determined not by a
          calculation, but by familiarity with the arctangent
          function. By itself, arctangent has a horizontal asymptote
          of <m>y = \frac{\pi}{2}</m> in the positive direction and
          <m> y = \frac{-\pi}{2}</m> in the negative direction.
          Multiplying by 8 means that we have a horizontal asymptote 
          of <m>y = 4\pi</m> in the positive direction and
          <m> y = -4\pi</m> in the negative direction. Adding 4 means
          that we have a horizontal asymptote of <m>y = 4\pi + 4 </m>
          in the positive direction and <m> y = -4\pi + 4 </m> in the

          either direction, as <m> x \rightarrow \infty</m>, this is
          exponential decay to zero. Therefore, <m>y=0</m> is a

          Both numerator and denominator have the same asymptotic

          stabilitzation to at the value <m>\frac{5}{28}</m>. This is

          The asymptotic order of the numerator and denominator are
          both <m>t^2</m>, so the limit as <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>
          is the ratio of the leading coefficients, which is 3. Even
          though this levels off, this is not logistic growth, since
          it doesn't conform to the specific construction of logistic
          growth with equivalent exponentials in both numerator and
          denominator.

          Looking at the sinusoidal term, the fraction before the sine
          function gives an amplitude. In the limit, this fraction has
          the same asymptotic order in the numerator and denominator,
          to its limit is <m>\frac{1}{9}</m>, the ratio of its leading
          coefficient. The long term behaviour of this function is
          osscilation around the equilibrium value of 400 with an
          amplitude of <m>\frac{1}{9}</m>. All these values are close
          to 400, but the function never approaches any one value;
          instead, the oscillations continue for ever. This is neither
          exponential or logistic growth.

          The exponential coefficient in the denominator is larger than
          the exponential coefficient the numerator, so the asymptotic
          order of the denominator is higher and the long term
          behaviour is decay to 0. This looks very close to logistic
          growth, but it isn't: the exponential coefficients are not
          the sam, and its doesn't level off to a non-zero carrying
          capacity.

          This is an exponential decay function. The long term
          behaviour is decay to zero.
