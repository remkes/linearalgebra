    <title>Examples in <m>\RR^2</m></title>
    <p>
      It is useful for us to specialize to transformations <m>\RR^2
      \rightarrow \RR^2</m>, in order to build experience and
      intuition  As we noted above, linear transformations preserve
      flat objects  What can we do to <m>\RR^2</m> that preserves
      lines and preserves the origin?
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are five basic types of linear transformation of
          <m>\RR^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Rotations</em> about the origin (either clockwise or
          counter-clockwise) preserve lines  We can't rotate around
          any other point, since that would move the origin  Since we
          can choose any angle, there are infinitely many such
          rotations  Also, since rotating by <m>\theta</m> radians
          clockwise is the same as <m>2\pi - \theta</m> radians
          counter-clockwise, we typically choose to only deal with
          counter-clockwise rotations  Counter-clockwise rotations
          are considered positive and clockwise rotations are
          considered negative.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Reflections</em> over lines through the origin preserve
          lines  The line of refleciton must passthrough the origin
          or else the reflection will move the origin  Since there
          are infinitely many different lines through the origin,
          there are infinitely many such reflections.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Skews</em> are a little tricker to visualize  A skew is
          a transformation that takes either veritcal or horizontal
          lines (but not both) and tilts them diagonally  It changes
          squares into parallelograms  The tilted lines are still
          lines, so it is a linear transformation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Dialations</em> are transformation which stretch or
          shink in various directions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Projections</em> are transformations which collapse
          <m>\RR^2</m> down to a line through the origin  Two
          important examples are projection onto either axis.
          Projection onto the <m>x</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m>
          to <m>(a,0)</m>, removing the <m>y</m> component  Likewise,
          projection onto the <m>y</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m>
          to <m>(0,b)</m>, removing the <m>x</m> component  In a
          similar manner, we can project onto any line though the
          origin by sending each point to the closest point on the
          line  Finally, there is the projection to the origin which
          sends all points to the origin.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We present the following interesting theorem without proof.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> are generated by
          composition of transformations of the previous five types.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
