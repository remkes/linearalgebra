      <solution>
        <p>
          We follow the process from the notes and the videos for
          solving the population equation. We start with dividing by
          <m>p(t)</m>. 
          <me>
            \frac{1}{p(t)} \frac{dp}{dt} = 0.03
          </me>
          Then we integrate both sides of the equation (the
          independent variable here is <m>t</m>.)
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{p(t)} \frac{dp}{dt} dt = \int (0.03) dt 
          </me>
          The right side is just the integral of a constant. For the
          left side, we use a substitution <m>u = p(t)</m>, so that
          <m> du = \frac{dp}{dt} dt </m>. With that substitution, we
          can replace all the pieces on the right side. 
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{u} du = (0.03t) + C 
          </me>
          Then we solve the left side integral. I won't use absolute
          value bars in the integral, since <m>u = p(t)</m> means
          that <m>u</m> is always positive (since population is always
          positive). 
          <me>
            \ln u = (0.03t) + C 
          </me>
          Then we can solve for u. 
          <me>
            u = e^{(0.03t) + C} = e^C e^{0.03t} 
          </me>
          Now we replace u. 
          <me>
            p(t) = e^C e^{0.03t} 
          </me>
          Finally, we use the initial value p(0) = 14000 
          <me>
            p(0) = e^C e^0 = e^C = 14000
          </me>
          This lets us write the final solution.
          <me>
            p(t) = 14000 e^{0.03t} 
          </me>
          This is exactly what we expect: population that starts at
          14000 with a growth rate coefficient of <m>0.03</m>.

            \frac{1}{p(t)} \frac{dp}{dt} = -0.14  
          </me>
          Then we integrate both sides of the equation (the
          independent variable here is <m>t</m>.)
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{p(t)} \frac{dp}{dt} dt = \int (-0.14) dt 
          </me>

            \ln u = (-0.14t) + C

          Then we can solve for u. 
          <me>
            u = e^{(-0.14t) + C} = e^C e^{-0.14t} 
          </me>
          Now we replace u. 
          <me>
            p(t) = e^C e^{-0.14t} 
          </me>
          Finally, we use the initial value p(0) = 150000
          <me>
            p(0) = e^C e^0 = e^C = 1500000
          </me>
          This lets us write the final solution.
          <me>
            p(t) = 150000 e^{-0.14t} 
          </me>

          We have to check two things. First, we can check that the
          initial value is correct. This is simply evaluating
          <m>p(0)</m>. 
          <me>
            p(0) = \frac{400000 e^0}{600 + 400
            e^0} = \frac{400000}{600+ 400} =
            \frac{400000}{1000} = 400
          </me>
          This is the correct initial value. Now we need to
          differentiate <m>p(t)</m> using the quotient rule and check
          that it is the same as the left side of the differential
          equation. This calculation is a bit complicated with many
          pieces, but I'll simplify it step by step.

          After all that simplification, we have this expression. This
          is the left side of the differential equation. We want to
          compare it to the right side of the differential equation.
          Let's try to calculate that right side and see if we can
          simplify it down to the same thing. From the third to the
          fourth line below, we go to common denominator for the term
          in brackets.

          This produces exactly the same expression. Both
          the left and ride sides of the equation simplify to the same
          expression. Therefore, since these simplification have made
          any actual changes to the function (just to how it is
          expressed), the right side and left side of the differential
          equation are equal, and we have confirmed that the given
