        <p>
          If we have a system of equations in the variables <m>x_1,
          x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>, the set of values for these variables
          which satisfy all the equations is called the
          <term>solution space</term> of the system. Since each set
          of values is a vector, we think of the solution space as a
          subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. For linear equations, the solution
          space will always be a affine subspace. If we have encoded
          the system of equations in an extended matrix, we can refer
          to the solution space of the matrix instead of the system.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Since solution spaces are affine, they can be written as
          <m>u + L</m> where <m>u</m> is a fixed offset vector and
          <m>L</m> is a linear space. Since <m>L</m> is linear, it
          has a basis <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots v_k</m> and any vector in
          <m>L</m> is a linear combination of the <m>v_i</m>. We can
          write any and all solutions to the system in the following
          fashion (where <m>a_i \in \RR</m>).
          <me>
            u + a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + a_3v_3 + \ldots + a_kv_k
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a description of the solution space, we call the
          <m>a_i</m> <term>free parameters</term>. One of our goals
          in solving systems is to determine the number of free
          parameters for each solution space.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's return to the example at the start of this section to
          understand how we read solutions from reduced row-echelon
          matrices.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This example is the easiest case: we have a leading one in
          each row and column left of the horizontal line, and we just
          read off the solution, <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and
          <m>z=8</m>. Several other things can happen, though, which
          we will also explain by examples.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We might have a row of zeros in the reduced row-echelon
          form.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8 \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This row of zeros doesn't actually change the solution at
          all: it is still <m>x=-3</m>, <m>y=-2</m> and <m>z=8</m>.
          The last line just corresponds to an equation which says
          <m>0x + 0y + 0z = 0</m> or just <m>0=0</m> which is always
          true. Rows of zeros arise from redundant equations in the
          original system.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We might have a column of zeros. Consider something similar
          to the previous examples, but now in four variables
          <m>w,x,y,z</m>. (In that order, so that the first column is
          the <m>w</m> column, the second is the <m>x</m> column, and
          so on).
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
            \amp -3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 8 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The translation gives <m>w=-3</m>, <m>x=-2</m> and
          <m>y=8</m> but the matrix says nothing about <m>z</m>. A
          column of zeros corresponds to a free variable: any value of
          <m>z</m> solves the system as long as the other variables
          are set.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The columns of a free variables need not contain all zeros.
          The following matrix is still in reduced row-echelon form.
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 2
            \amp -3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp
            0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp 8 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Reduced row-echelon form needs a leading one in each
          non-zero row, and all other entries in a column with a lead
          one must be zero. This matrix satisfies all the conditions.
          The fourth column corresponds to the <m>z</m> variable, but
          lacks a leading one. Any column lacking a leading one
          corresponds to a free variable. Look at the translation of
          this matrix back into a linear system.

              w + 2z \amp  = -3
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x - z \amp  = -2

        <p>
          Let's move the <m>z</m> terms to the right side.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              w \amp  = - 2z - 3
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x \amp  = z - 2
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              y \amp  = z + 8
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              z \amp  = z
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We've added the last equation, which is trivial to satisfy,
          to show how all the terms depend on <m>z</m>. This makes it
          clear that <m>z</m> is a free variable, since we can write
          the solution as follows:
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + z
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any choice of <m>z</m> will solve this system. If we want
          specific solutions, we take specific values of <m>z</m>.
          For example, if <m>z=1</m>, these equations give <m>w=-5,
          x=-1</m> and <m>y=9</m>. Moreover, this solutions is
          explicity given as an offset spane, where the columns of
          constants is the offset and the free variable gives the
          span.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-description-by-parameters">
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can go further. The following matrix is also in reduced
          row-echelon form (again, using <m>w</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>
          and <m>z</m> as variables in that order).
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 2
            \amp -3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -2
            \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, both the third and the fourth columns have no leading
          one, therefore, both <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are free
          variables. We translate the matrix back into a linear
          system.
          <md>

            \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + y
            \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + z
            \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any choice of <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> gives a solution. For
          example, if <m>y=0</m> and <m>z=1</m> then <m>w=-5</m> and
          <m>x=-1</m> completes a solution. Since we have all these
          choices, any system with a free variable has infinitely many
          solutions.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Finally, we can also have a reduced row-echelon matrix of
          the following form. 
          <me>
            \left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 8 \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{array} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first three rows translate well. However, the fourth
          row translates to <m>0x+0y+0z = 1</m> or <m>0=1</m>.
          Obviously, this can never be satisfied. Any row which
          translates to <m>0=1</m> leads to a contradiction: this
          means that the system has no solutions, since we can never
          satisfy an equation like <m>0=1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We summarize the three possible situations for reduced
      row-echelon matrices.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there is a row which translates to <m>0=1</m>, then
            there is a contradiction and the system has no solutions.
            This overrides any other information: whether or not there
            are free variables elsewhere, there are still no
            solutions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there are no <m>0=1</m> rows and all columns left of
            the vertical line have leading ones, then there is a
            unique solution. There are no columns representing free
            variables, and each variable has a specific value which we
            can read directly from the matrix.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there are no <m>0=1</m> rows and there is at least one
            column left of the vertical line without a leading one,
            then each such column represents a free variable. The
            remaining variables can be expressed in terms of the free
            variables and any choices of the free variables leads to a
            solution. There are infinitely many solutions. The
            solutions space can always be expressed as a offset span.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, note that there are only three basic cases for
      the number of solutions: none, one, or infinitely many. No
      linear system has exactly two or exactly three solutions. In
      the case of infinitely many solutions, the interesting question
      is the dimension of the solution space. This question, however,
      is easily answered.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The dimension of a solution space of a linear system of
          equations is the number of free variables.
