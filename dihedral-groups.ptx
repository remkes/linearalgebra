    <title>Dihedral Groups</title>
    <p>
      The case of regular polygons, such as the hexagon, is a very
      useful place for us to start. Transformations which do not
      preserve flat objects may not going to preserve the edges of the
      polygons. Therefore, we want to know which linear
      transformations preserve the regular polygons.
    </p>

        <p>
          A <term>Dihedral Group</term> is the group of linear
          symmetries of a regular polygon. If the polygon has
          <m>n</m> edges, then we write <m>D_n</m> for the associated
          dihedral group. Thus, <m>D_3</m> is the group of symmetries
          of the triangle, <m>D_4</m> is the group of symmetries of
          the square, <m>D_5</m> is the group of symmetries of the
          pentagon, and so on. (Some texts use <m>D_{2n}</m> instead
          of <m>D_n</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's first consider the square. For all the polygons we
          are considering, we assume the origin is at the centre of
          the polygon. We can assume the square has vertices
          <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>, <m>(-1,-1)</m> and
          <m>(-1,1)</m>. Conveniently, the vertices are all we need
          to think about: since linear transformations preserve lines,
          if we know where the vertices go, then we know that the
          lines connecting them are preserved and hence the shape is
          preseved. Which transformations preserve the vertices?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two relatively obvious classes that might occur to
          us. First, there are rotation about the origin. If we
          rotate by <m>\pi/2</m> radians (a quarter turn), the
          vertices are preserved. Likewise for rotations by
          <m>\pi</m> and <m>3\pi/2</m> radians. If we are really
          paying attention, we might also think of rotation by
          <m>2\pi</m> radians, a full turn. This might seem silly,
          but the identity transformation (the transformation that
          leaves everything fixed) is a very important transformation
          and should be included in the list. So, for now, we have
          the identity and three rotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might also think about reflections. Looking at the
          square, we can find four lines of reflection: the
          <m>x</m>-axs, the <m>y</m>-axis, the line <m>x=y</m> and the
          line <m>x=-y</m>. That brings the total number of
          transformation to eight: the identity, three rotations, and
          four reflections. These eight are, in face, the complete
          group.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that we used the work <sq>group</sq>
      instead of <sq>set</sq> to describe this collection.
      <sq>Group</sq> is a technical word in mathematics, refering to a
      set with some extra properties. We won't go into the formal
      details, but we'll use the dihedral groups as archetypical
      examples. There are three properties of the dihedral groups
      which hold for all groups.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The composition of two elements of the group is still in
            the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The identity transformation is in the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The inverse operation of any group element is still a
            group element.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we haven't formally defined inverses, the third property
      is not to hard to see for the dihedral groups. For the
      reflections, if we perform the reflection again we get back to
      where we started. The reflections are their own inverses. For
      rotations, we add another rotation so that we have completed a
      full turn. The inverse of rotation by <m>\pi/2</m> radians is
      rotation by <m>3\pi/2</m> radians. Equivalently, the inverse is
      rotation by <m>-\pi/2</m> radians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first property is a little trickier. We leave it to you to
      try out some compositions of rotations and reflections to see
      how the result is still one of the eight symmetries. Likewise,
      we leave it to you to extend this analysis of <m>D_4</m> to
      other diheadral groups:
      <m>D_3</m>, <m>D_5</m>, <m>D_6</m> and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All dihedral groups are composed of the identity, some
      rotations, and some reflections. <m>D_4</m> is a useful enough
      example that we should fix notation. I or <m>\Id</m> is the
      identity transformation, <m>R_1</m> is rotation by <m>\pi/2</m>
      radians, <m>R_2</m> is rotation by <m>\pi</m>radians and
      <m>R_3</m> is rotation by <m>3\pi/2</m> radians. <m>F_1</m> is
      reflection over the <m>x</m> axis, <m>F_2</m> over <m>x=y</m>,
      <m>F_3</m> over the <m>y</m> axis and <m>F_4</m> over
      <m>y=-x</m>.
