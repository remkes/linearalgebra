          Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
          The <term>order</term> of <m>A</m> is the smallest positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>A^n = \Id</m>.
          If no such integer exists, the order of <m>A</m> is <m>\infty</m>.

          Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix and <m>v \in \RR^n</m>.

          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be
          <m>n \times n</m> matrices with <m>B</m> invertible.
          The <term>conjugation</term> of <m>A</m> by <m>B</m> is the matrix <m>B^{-1}AB</m>.
          (In some contexts, conjugation is <m>BAB^{-1}</m>.
          We will always write the inverse on the left.)

    <p>
      To define conjugation
      (and have it mean anything interesting),
      we require the non-commutativity of matrix multiplication.
      If matrix multiplication were commutative,
      we could calculate <m>B^{-1}AB = B^{-1}BA = A</m>,
      and conjugation would have no effect.
      Conjugation works because of the non-commutativity of matrix multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conjugation changes the matrix <m>A</m>,
      but tends to keep some similarity to the original matrix.
      It also divides matrix groups into classes which share certain similarities or properties.

          Let <m>G</m> be a group of linear transformations.
          Let <m>A \in G</m>.
          The <term>conjugacy class</term> of <m>A</m> is the set of all matrices which are conjugates of <m>A</m> by any other <m>B \in G</m>.
