          Complete this table by writing <q>Yes</q> or <q>No</q> in
          each space. Write <q>Yes</q> is the set in question include
          the structure (the structure must remain in the set); write
          <q>No</q> if the set does not include the structure. (The set
          <m>\ZZ/12\ZZ</m> is the integers modulo 12. If this set is
          unfamiliar, you may treat it as the numbers on the clock.
          So, for example, if we want to add <m>7 + 9</m>, we ask what
          time is 9 hours after 7, which is 4. Therefore <m>7 + 9 =
          4</m> in the arithimetic in this set. Also, a set has zero
          divisors if there are two non-zero elements <m>a</m> and
          <m>b</m> which multiply to zero.)

        <p>
          Hopefully, most of these answers are straightforward. I'll
          comment on a few, thought, which might be less obvious. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              The natural numbers can still be said to have absolute
              value, but the structure doesn't do anything. The
              absolute value of a positive number is itself, so the
              structure is very boring: all numbers are unchanged.
              This is why I wrote <q>trivially</q>, to indicate that
              the structure doesn't do anything.
            </li>
            <li>
              Division for the integers modulo 12 is tricky. We might
              thing that since we can extend addition, subtraction and
              multiplication just fine modulo 12, we could extend
              division as well. The problem is zero divisors: if we
              allow division by zero divisors, the arithmetic breaks.
              This is not immediate to see, so I didn't really expect
              anyone to know this unless you've previously studied
              modular arithmetic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Speaking of zero divisiors, take the numbers 3 and 4 in
              the integers modulo 12. Their product is 12, which is
              the same as 0 in that system. So, we can reasonable say
              that <m>3 \times 4 = 0</m> in the integers modulo 12.
              Since 3 and 4 are not also equivalent to zero
              themselves, they are zero divisors. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether or not we have an order relation on the integers
              modulo 12 is also tricky. We can impose an order, saying
              that <m>1 \lt 2 \lt 3 \lt \ldots \lt 11 \lt 12</m>.
              However, since the numbers loop around, if we keep going
              from 12 back to 1, this seems intuitively probelmatic
              with this order. So, even though we could impose such an
              order, I think it makes more sense not to, and say that
              the integer modulo 12 are not ordered. If we think about
              time on a clock, I think we can justify this decision.
              If it is currently 10 o'clock, then there is a time
              before that was 5 o'clock as well as a time in the
              future which will also be 5 o'clock. Therefore, puting
              an order seems unreasonable.

          The structures we've included so far have mostly be binary
          operations (the conventional four of arithmetic) and some
          other familiar things like order and absolute value.
          However, structures can be as complicated as we like. Here
          are some more involved structures. For each structure, give
          an example of a number set that has the structure. (Some of
          these are a bit tricky: you are allowed to restrict the
          conventional number sets to make this work. For example, the
          set of all positive rational number might is a number set,
          as is the set of all natural numbers less that 40.) 
          <ol>
            <li>
              Decomposition of numbers into prime factors (except for
              0 and 1).

              All numbers have square roots.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are a variety of possible answers, but here are my
          suggestions for some reasonable responses.
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Decomposition of numbers into prime factors (except for
              0 and 1): This is true of <m>/NN</m>. Positive whole
              numbers (larger than 1) do decompose into prime factors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reciprocals of non-zero numbers: <m>\QQ</m> or
              <m>\RR</m> would work here, since those number sets have
              division and reciprocals are just a specific instance of
              division. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability to do long division with remainder: this
              works in <m>\NN</m>. Note that remainder is important
              here: division is not exact in <m>/NN</m>, since we
              don't have fractions. However, we can say that 7 goes
              into 40 five time, with remainder 5 --- that still just
              uses whole numbers. 
            </li>
            <li>
              You can get the whole set just by starting with 1 and
              allowing yourself to do any number of additions: this is
              true for <m>/NN</m>. Any positive number can be thought
              of as adding 1 some number of times. For example: <m>8 =
              1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</m>. In this way, the
              number 1 and the addition operation generate all of the
              natural numbers. 
            </li>
            <li>
              All numbers have square roots. This is a bit tricky,
              since none of our conventional number sets have this
              property. We have to make a restriction. We certainly
              want to work with real numbers, since we know that
              <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is already irration. We're not going to
              find square roots in the natural numbers, the integers,
              or the rational numbers. But the negative numbers cause
              a problem: they do not have square roots in the real
              numbers. We can exclude these by taking the set of all
              positive real numbers. This set has the structure of all
              numbers having square roots. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The existence of a maximal element (some number in the
              set which is larger than all other numbers). Again, no
              standard number set will have this structure, since they
              are all unbounded and keep getting larger forever.
              However, we can make a restriction and take a bounded
              subset. Consider, for eample, all natural number less
              that 40 (as I suggested in the statmeent of the
              problem). This set has a maximal element of 39, since
              everything else in the set is a whole number less than
              39.
