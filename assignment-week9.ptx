        For this incomplete matrix, add a fourth column which makes
        the matrix orthogonal. (4)

        Find a counter example of a matrix that preserve angles but is
        not an orthogonal matrix. Show that your matrix has a
        determinant not equation to <m>\pm 1</m>. (4)

        Create a multiplication table for <m>D_6</m>. (You do not need
        to show all the vertex calculation, but show at least a few
        from different parts of the table to give examples of how you
        did the calculation. Label the identity as <m>\Id</m>. Label
        the rotation as <m>R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4</m> and <m>R_5</m> as
        counterclockwise rotation of one-sixth of a turn, two sixths
        of a turn, and so on. Label a reflection through two vertices
        (along the <m>x</m>-axis if you wish) as <m>F_1</m>. The label
        the remaining reflections as <m>F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5</m> and
        <m>F_6</m> so that each line reflection is the next line
        moving counterclockwise. In this way, <m>F_1</m>, <m>F_3</m>
        and <m>F_5</m> are relfections over lines through two vertices
        and <m>F_2</m>, <m>F_4</m> amd <m>F_6</m> are reflections over
        lines through the midpoints of two edges. (10)
