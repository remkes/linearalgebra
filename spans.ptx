      In addition to presenting the second description of linear
      subspaces, this chapter also introduces linear combinations,
      span and linear (in)dependence. These are some of the most
      important and central definition in linear algebra.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>linear combination</term> of a set of vectors
          <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m> is a sum of the form <m>a_1
          v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \ldots a_k v_k</m> where the <m>a_i \in
          \RR</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>span</term> of a set of vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2,
          \ldots, v_k\}</m>, written <m>\Span \{v_1, v_2, \ldots,
          v_k\}</m>, is the set of <term>all</term> linear
          combinations of the vectors.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      After loci, spans are the second way of defining linear
      subspaces. Span are never affine: since linear combinations
      allow for all the coefficients <m>a_i</m> to be zero, spans
      always include the origin. To use spans to define affine
      subspaces, we have to add an offset vector.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>offset span</term> is an affine subspace formed by
          adding a fixed vector <m>u</m>, called the <term>offset
          vector</term>, to the span of some set of vectors.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Loci are built top-down, by starting with the ambient space and
      reducing the number of points by imposing restrictions in the
      form of linear equations. Their dimension, at least ideally, is
      the dimension of the ambient space minus the number of equations
      or restrictions. Spans, on the other hand, are built bottom-up.
      They start with a number of vectors and take all linear
      combinations: more starting vectors leads to more independent
      directions and a larger dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, the span of one non-zero vector is the line
      (through the origin) consisting of all multiples of that vector.
      Similarly, we expect the span of two vectors to be a plane.
      However, here we have the same problem as we had with loci: we
      may have redundant information. For example, in <m>\RR^2</m>,
      we could consider the span <m>\Span \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\
      2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
      \right\}</m>. We would hope the span of two vectors would be the
      entire plane, but this is just the line in the direction
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}</m> . The vector
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , since it is
      already a multiple of <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2
      \end{pmatrix}</m> , is redundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is magnified in higher dimensions. If we have the
      span of a large number of vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>, it is nearly
      impossible to tell, at a glance, whether any of the vectors are
      redundant. We would like to have tools to determine this
      redundancy. As with the tools for dimensions of loci, we have
      to wait until a later section of these notes.

    <title>Dimension and Basis</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A set of vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m> in
          <m>\RR^n</m> is called <term>linearly independent</term> if
          the equation
          <me>
            a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + a_3 v_3 + \ldots + a_k v_k = 0
          </me>
          has only the trivial solution: for all <m>i</m>, <m>a_i =
          0</m>. If a set of vectors isn't linearly independent, it
          is called <term>linearly dependant</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This may seem like a strange definition, but it algebraically
      captures the idea of independent directions. A set of vectors
      is linearly independent if all of them point in fundamentally
      different directions. We could also say that a set of vectors
      is linearly independent if no vector is in the span of the other
      vectors. No vector is a redundant piece of information; if we
      remove any vectors, the span of the set gets smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for a set like this to be linearly independent, we need
      <m>k \leq n</m>. <m>\RR^n</m> has only <m>n</m> independent
      directions, so it is impossible to have more than <m>n</m>
      linearly independent vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be a linear subspace of <m>\RR^n</m>. Then
          <m>L</m> has <term>dimension k</term> if <m>L</m> can be
          written as the span of <m>k</m> linearly independent
          vectors.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be an affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> and write
          <m>A</m> as <m>A = u + L</m> for <m>L</m> a linear subspace
          and <m>u</m> a offset vector. Then <m>A</m> has
          <term>dimension k</term> if <m>L</m> has dimension
          <m>k</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is the proper, complete definition of dimension for linear
      and affine spaces. It solves the problem of redundant
      information (either redundant equations for loci or redundant
      vectors for spans) by insisting on a linearly independent
      spanning set.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be a linear subspace of <m>\RR^n</m>. A
          <term>basis</term> for <m>L</m> is a minimal spanning set;
          that is, a set of linearly independent vectors which span
          <m>L</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Since a span is the set of all linear combinations, we can think
      of a basis as as way of writing the vectors of <m>L</m>: every
      vector in <m>L</m> can be written as a linear combination of the
      basis vectors. A basis gives a nice way to account for all the
      vectors in <m>L</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linear subspaces have many (infinitely many) different bases.
      There are some standard choices.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>standard basis</term> of <m>\RR^2</m> is composed
          of the two unit vectors in the positive <m>x</m> and
          <m>y</m> directions. We can write any vector as a linear
          combination of the basis vectors.
          <md>
            <mrow>
            e_1 \amp = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \amp 
            e_2 \amp = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \amp 
            \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \amp = x e_1 + y e_2
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>standard basis</term> of <m>\RR^3</m> is composed
          of the three unit vectors in the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>
          and <m>z</m> directions. We can again write any vector as a
          linear combination of the basis vectors.
          <md>
            <mrow>
            e_1 \amp = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
            \amp e_2 \amp = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0
            \end{pmatrix} \amp e_3 \amp = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\
            1 \end{pmatrix} \amp \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}
            \amp = x e_1 + y e_2 + z e_3
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>standard basis</term> of <m>\RR^n</m> is composed
          of vectors <m>e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n</m> where <m>e_i</m> has
          a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>th component and zeroes in all
          other components. <m>e_i</m> is the unit vector in the
          positive <m>i</m>th axis direction.
